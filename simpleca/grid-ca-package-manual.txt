== NAME ==
grid-ca-package - Prepare a CA certificate, configuration, and policy for distribution

== SYNOPSIS ==
**++grid-ca-package++** [++-help++ ] [++-h++ ] [++-usage++ ] [++-version++ ] [++-versions++ ] 

== Description ==

The **++grid-ca-package++** utility creates a tarball containing an RPM
spec file and the files needed to use a CA with grid tools. It
optionally will also create a GPT package for distributing a CA. 

By default, the **++grid-ca-package++** utility displays a list of
installed grid CA and prompts for which CA to package. It then creates a
tarball containing the CA certificate, signing policy, CA configuration
files, and an spec script to generate a binary RPM package containing
the CA. If the CA hash is known prior to running
**++grid-ca-package++**, it may provided as an argument to the '-ca'
parameter to avoid prompting. **++grid-ca-package++** may also be used
to package a SimpleCA directory, using the '-cadir' parameter. 

In addition to generating a spec script and tarball,
**++grid-ca-package++** creates a GPT package if either the '-g' or '-b'
options are used on the command-line. These packages may be used to
distribute a CA and configuration to systems which do not support RPM
packages. 

The **++grid-ca-package++** utility writes the package tarballs to the
current working directory. 

The full set of command-line options to **++grid-ca-package++** follows.


**-help, -h, -usage**::
     Display the command-line options to **++grid-ca-package++** and exit.

**-version, -versions**::
     Display the version number of the **++grid-ca-package++** command. The second form includes more details.

**-ca 'CA'**::
     Use the CA whose name matches the hash string 'CA'. When invoked with this option, **++grid-ca-package++** runs non-interactively.

**-cadir 'SIMPLECADIR'**::
     Use the SimpleCA located in 'SIMPLECADIR' When invoked with this option, **++grid-ca-package++** runs non-interactively.

**-g**::
     Create a GPT binary package in addition to the RPM script tarball. This package may be installed on other systems using the **++gpt-install++** program.

**-b**::
     Create a GPT binary package with GPT metadata located in the path expected by GPT 3.2 (used in Globus 2.0.0-5.0.x) instead of ++${datadir}/globus/packages++ as used in Globus 5.2.x. This option overrides the  as used in Globus 5.2.x. This option overrides the '-g' command-line option.

**-r**::
     Create a binary RPM package for the CA. This option currently only works on RPM-based distributions.

**-d**::
     Create a binary Debian package for the CA. This option currently only works on Debian-based distributions.
