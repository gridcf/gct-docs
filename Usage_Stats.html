<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

<p>Beginning with GT 3.9.5, the Globus Toolkit has the capability to send usage
  statistics back to the Globus Alliance.</p>

<h2><a name="whyarewedoingthis"></a>Why are we doing this?</h2>  
<p>  The Globus Alliance receives support from government funding agencies. In
  a time of funding scarcity, these agencies must be able to demonstrate that
    the scientific community is benefiting from their investment. To this end,
we want to provide generic usage data about such things as the following: </p>
<UL>
  <LI>how many people use GridFTP </LI>
    
  <LI>how many jobs run using GRAM </LI>
</UL>
<p>To this end, we have added support to the Globus Toolkit that will allow installations
to send us generic usage statistics. By participating in this project, you help
our funders to justify continuing their support for the software on which you
rely.</p>
<h2><a name="theoverview"></a>The overview </h2>  
<ul>
  <li>Components affected for GT6 are:
    <ul>
      <li>GridFTP</li>
      <li>GRAM5</li>
      <li>MyProxy</li>
      <li>GSI-OpenSSH</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The data sent is as generic as possible (see <a href=#whatissent>What
      is Sent?</a> below). </li>
  <li>Every component affected has a section titled "Usage
    Statistics" in its Users and Admin guides that lists precisely what
    is sent and the configuration control that is
    available (which you can use to <strong>disable</strong> the ability to send the data). </li>
  <li>To make this a win-win proposition, we have made
        the receiver for the data available (follow the directions <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~bester/usagestats_server/">here</a>).
        This means that a (virtual) organization could set up their own listener
        and collect organization wide usage statistics. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="optout"></a>Opt-out</h2> 
We are using opt-out rather than opt-in. The reason is that we <it>need</it> this
data - it is a requirement for funding. We're
sure our fellow users would be willing to help show that Grid Computing works
and is in use. Realistically, however, we know that if it requires any additional
effort to set up usage statistic reporting, it would drastically reduce the number
of users that would actually report the data. To be effective, we need to require
zero additional effort.
<p>By not opting out, and allowing these statistics to be reported back, you
are explicitly supporting the further development of the Globus Toolkit.</p>




<h2><a name="whatissent" id="whatissent"></a>What is sent?</h2> 
<p>The components affected for GT5 are GridFTP, RLS, GRAM5, MyProxy and GSI-OpenSSH. We send the "how much" data,
  not "the
  what" data.  </p>
<p>For instance, GridFTP sends the number of bytes, how long the
    transfer took, how many streams were used, etc. It does NOT send filenames,
    usernames, or even the destination IP since that would mean that the source
    site would make a decision about sending information about the destination
    site. </p>
<p>Each component has a section in its Users  and Admin guides listing what
  component specific data is sent, and the Admin guide explains 
  configurations related to the usage statistics. 
  Links to these sections are provided here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="gridftp/admin/#gridftp-usage">GridFTP</a></li>
  <li><a href="gram5/admin/#gram5-usage">GRAM5</a></li>
  <li><a href="myproxy/admin/#myproxy-usage">MyProxy</a></li>
  <li><a href="openssh/admin/#openssh-usage">GSI-OpenSSH</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Header data that may be sent by every component, not including the component-specific
  data listed above, are:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Component identifier </li>
    <li> Usage data format identifier </li>
    <li> Time stamp </li>
    <li> Source IP address </li>
    <li> Source hostname (to differentiate between hosts with identical private IP addresses)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="howisthedatasent"></a>How is the data sent?</h2>  <p>The messages are sent as a single UDP packet.  While this may cause us to lose some data, it drastically reduces the possibility that the usage statistics reporting can adversely affect the operation of the software.</p>

<h2><a name="whenisthedatasent"></a>When is the data sent?</h2>  <p>Once per "task" (GridFTP transfer, GRAM Job, etc), either immediately upon startup, or at completion of the task.</p>

<h2><a name="whatwillitbeusedfor"></a>What will the data be used for?</h2> 
<p>The data will be used for answering questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How many jobs were run with GRAM last month? </li>
  <li>How many gigabytes of data has
            GridFTP moved? </li>
</ul>
<p>We will also try and mine the data to answer operational questions such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> What percentage
            of the jobs run complete successfully? </li>
  <li>Of the ones that
              fail, what is the most common fault code returned?</li>
</ul>
<p>The data will <strong>NOT</strong> be used to answer questions such as &quot;IP 123.456.789.012
  sent 10 TB of data last month.&quot; </p>
<p>Our intent is to make the data that we get generic enough that
      we do not have to worry what is done with it. We record
      the IP only for counting purposes to know how many sites there
  are, but we will not produce site-specific statistics. </p>
<h2><a name="feedback"></a>Feedback</h2>
<p>Please send us your feedback at <a href="mailto:usage-stats@globus.org">usage-stats@globus.org</a>.
Feedback from our user communities will be useful in determining our path forward
with this in the future. We do ask that if you have concerns or objections, please
be specific in your feedback. For example: "Our site has a policy against sending
such data" is good information for us to know in the future.  A link to such
a policy would be even better.</p>
