[[gridftp-admin-tuning]]
== Key Admin Settings and Tuning Recommendations ==


--
The **++globus-gridftp-server++** is a flexible and tunable piece of
software. It is easy for an admin to get lost in all of the options it
offers. This document intends to highlight some of the more commonly
important options related to performance and robustness. It does not
intend to account for all of the options but rather to give the system
administator a better perspective into how to set some of the less
obvious controls.


--

=== Concurrent Instances ===

A very important option for a system administrator to set is the number
of simultaneous GridFTP transfers allowed. In other words, the number of
clients that are allowed to connect to the server at the same time.

GridFTP is designed to be a high performance, on-demand data transfer
service. Quite a bit of system resources (mainly memory) are allocated
to each client connection and this is with the assumption that the
session will consume even more system resources (CPU, net/disk
bandwidth) when performing a high speed data transfer. For this reason,
the system administrator must evaluate the resource their host machine
has to offer and set a reasonable limit to the number of client connects
allowed at one time.

When determining the instance concurrency level, there are two major
factors to consider: **system memory** helps determine the upper limit
of the instance range and **available I/O bandwidth** helps determine
the lower limit.


==== System memory considerations ====

First and foremost is system memory. The recommended instance count
based on system memory is: 

--------
instance count = system memory / 34
--------


Each instance of a GridFTP server will require about 2MB of memory just
to handle the connection in a sane way. Beyond that is the amount of
memory required to handle a fast, TCP-based data transfer. A safe rule
of thumb here is 32MB. This allows for a TCP buffer size of 16MB (which
is a common client selection for high performance WAN bandwidth delay
products) and a user space buffer to match that value. 2MB + 16MB + 16MB
= 34MB, thus the denominator in the above formula.


==== I/O bandwidth considerations ====

Simultaneous clients share the available I/O resources. Most often it is
beneficial to allocate enough bandwidth so that each client can transfer
data at an acceptable rate. In a simple model, the higher the instance
count, the lower the transfer rates for each client. At some point it is
beneficial for the GridFTP server to reject connections in an attempt to
provide a higher level of service to its currently connected clients.
There is also a point where too many simultaneous clients can cause
thrashing and drop network packets. Obviously this situation should be
avoided.

While no client wants to be rejected, a higher level service can take
advantage of this by either trying again later at a more efficient time,
reordering its work load, or finding a replica. RFT provides some of
this functionality and other such services are being researched and
designed.


==== Why More Than One? ====

When considering the right concurrent instance level it is helpful to
consider why there should ever be more than one at a time. There are
three major reasons for this:



. **The other side of the connection is the bottleneck.**
+
If we assume that each transfer moves as fast as our system can send it,
then, when considering overall throughput, having two connections going
at half speed is roughly the same thing as having 2 full speed
connections run one at a time. However, if the remote end of the
connection is the bottleneck, then there is unused local bandwidth from
which another simultaneous connection and thus the overall system can
benefit.

. **Hide the overhead.**
+
Another important aspect of simultaneous connections is that the needed
overhead of control messaging can be overlapped with the payload of
another sessions data transfer. Hiding this processing and messaging
latency makes for a more efficient system with a higher overall
throughput.

. **Provide an interactive service.**
+
In some case, users may find connection rejections unacceptable and
would prefer a slower overall system provided they could connect to it
immediately for the purpose of an interactive session.


In the case of #3 the the highest safe level of instance count possible
is ideal. In the other two case the ideal number is less deterministic.
At least 10 instance is always recommended.


==== Setting the instance cap ====

If using GFork or Xinetd, set the instance cap by adding the following
line to the configuration file: 

--------
instance = <integer>
--------


If running the GridFTP server as a daemon, use the following option to
set the instance cap: 

--------
 -connections-max <integer>
--------



=== Disk Block Size ===

The **++globus-gridftp-server++** sits on top of various file systems.
Each file system has its own ideal access patterns and I/O buffer sizes.
To provide the user with some means of control, we offer the option: 

--------
-blocksize <number>
--------


This number indicates the size of the read requests posted to the disk.


=== Host Tuning ===

We recommend that you update the kernel TCP buffer settings and TCP
congestion control algorithm as recommended
http://fasterdata.es.net/fasterdata/host-tuning/[here] for achieving
maximum performance.


=== Data Interface ===

On systems that have multiple network interfaces, the system admin
likely wants to associate data transfers with the fastest possible NIC
available. This can be done in the GridFTP server by using the option: 

--------
--data-interface <ip address>
--------


 
[[gridftp-admin-advanced]]
== Advanced Configuration ==


--
It is assumed that the toolkit installation was successful. For more
information, see the link:../../admin/install/index.html[]. Also be sure
to reference link:#gridftp-configuring[] and
link:../..gridftp/admin/index.html#globus-gridftp-server[**++globus-gridftp-server++**].

[[gridftp-config-udt]]
=== Configuring GridFTP to use UDT instead of TCP ===

UDT is bundled with Globus starting with Globus v4.2, so downloading UDT
separately is no longer needed. 


==== Prerequisites ====



. Threaded Globus GridFTP server. In GT6, the server is non-threaded by
default. Refer to
link:../..gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-admin-installing-threaded[]
for information on how to enable threading in GridFTP server.

. For client-server transfers, threaded globus-url-copy. For third-party
(server-server) transfers, threaded globus-url-copy is not needed. Refer
to
link:../..gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-admin-installing-threaded[]
for information on how to enable threading in globus-url-copy.



==== Steps ====



. Build and install UDT
+
+
--------
globus$ make udt
--------
or 
+
--------
globus$ make gridftp udt
--------
if gridftp is not built and installed already)
+
+
--------
globus$ make install
--------

. Configure GridFTP server
+
If you run the GridFTP server from xinetd, add ++-dc-whitelist
udt,gsi,tcp++ to ++server_args++ in ++/etc/xinetd.d/gsiftp++
+
Alternatively, you can use the file
++$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp.conf++ to configure this. Add the
following to that file:  to configure this. Add the following to that
file: 
+
--------
dc_whitelist udt,gsi,tcp
--------
.
+
If you run the server from the command line: 
+
--------
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -dc-whitelist udt,gsi,tcp
--------

. Run globus-url-copy with new command line option "-udt"



[[gridftp-admin-separated]]
=== Separation of Processes (Split Process) ===

The GridFTP server can be separated into front end and data node
processes. This is the architecture used to achieve a striped server,
but it can also be exploited to achieve a higher level of security.

Running the server as ++root++ is often desirable because it allows the
server to fork and setuid on a child process related to an authenticated
user. This allows the server to leverage the operating system's file
system permissions and other security devices. However, it is not at all
desirable to have a ++root++-running process listening on a port open to
the world. If an attacker were to compromise the process, they could
obtain root-level access to the machine.

To overcome this security risk, the GridFTP server can be run in a front
end/back end manner. The front end can be run as any user, say user
++globus++, that has very limited access to the machine. The front end
is the process open to the outside world. If it is compromised, an
attacker has only gained access to that limited account. The back end is
run as root, but configured to only allow connections from the front
end.

This does, however, require that a copy of the
link:../../admin/install/index.html#gtadmin-basic-host[host cert and
host key] be owned by the non-privileged user. If you use this
configuration, the non-privileged user should not have write permission
to executables, configuration files, etc. This provides greater security
and also allows for proxying and load balancing. Many backend data
movers can be behind a single point of client contact. Each client is
assigned a different backend in a round robin fashion.

To start the front end, run:



--------
globus-gridftp-server -p 7000 -r localhost:7001
--------

To start the back end, run:



--------
globus-gridftp-server -p 7001 -dn -allow-from 127.0.0.1
--------


[[gridftp-admin-striped]]
=== Configuring GridFTP for Cluster-to-Cluster (or Striped) data movement ===

The GridFTP server supports separate front end (client control
connection) and back end (data node) processes. In addition, a single
front end process may connect to multiple back end data nodes.

When multiple back end data nodes are available, the server is said to
be in a **striped** configuration, or simply, is a striped server. In
this mode, transfers are divided over all available data nodes, thus
allowing the combined bandwidth of all data nodes to be used.

This is recommended for improved performance of large (1GB+) file
transfers. This can also be useful if you want to use full data
encryption and need to tether together many hosts to handle the
processing load. 

[NOTE]
--
The connection between the front end and data nodes is referred to as
the **IPC channel**.

--
The ability to use inetd or daemon execution modes applies to both front
end servers and data nodes, and the same certificate and user
requirements apply.

To start the front end, run: 

--------
globus-gridftp-server <args> -r <host:port>[,<host:port>,...]
--------
To start the data-node, run: 

--------
globus-gridftp-server -p <port> -dn
--------
The ++-p <port>++ option used on the data-node is the port that will be
used for IPC connections. This is the port that you will register with
the front end server.

For example: 

--------
machineB> globus-gridftp-server -p 6000 -dn
machineC> globus-gridftp-server -p 7000 -dn
machineA> globus-gridftp-server -p 5000 -r machineB:6000,machineC:7000
--------
The client would only connect to the front end at ++machineA:5000++, for
example, using globus-url-copy with the '-stripe' option: 

--------
globus-url-copy -stripe gsiftp://machineA:5000/file file:///destination
   or
globus-url-copy -stripe gsiftp://machineA:5000/file gsiftp://machineX/destination
--------
Where machineX may be another striped server or a standard GridFTP
server.


[[combo-striped-split]]
=== Combining Split Process and Striped configuration ===

Furthermore striped servers and split process can be combined. You can
have an 8 node cluster that only uses 2 nodes at a time in a striped
server configuration and load balances across the rest of the nodes.
TODO: any other details here?


[[chroot-gridftp]]
=== Configuring chrooted GridFTP server ===

GridFTP server can be configured to restrict access to specific path
using the command-line option '-chroot-path <path>' This path must
contain a valid certificate structure, /etc/passwd, and /etc/groups. A
helper script 'globus-gridftp-server-setup-chroot' available in
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin, can help create a suitable directory structure. 


[[gridftp-admin-server-gfork]]
=== Running with GFork Master Plugin ===

GFork is a service like inetd that listens on a TCP port and runs a
configurable executable in a child process whenever a connection is
made. GFork also creates bi-directional pipes between the child
processes and the master service. These pipes are used for interprocess
communication between the child process executables and a master process
plugin. More information on GFork can be found
link:#gridftp-admin-gfork-master[here].


[[gridftp-user-access]]
=== Accessing data from other data interfaces ===


include::../GridFTP_DSI_General_Frag.txt[]


[[gridftp-admin-dsis]]
==== Plugging in a Data Storage Interface (DSI) ====

GridFTP can be used as a network interface to existing Data Storage
Interfaces (DSIs) using the '-dsi' option. With this option the DSI
plugs into the backend (compatible with striping) and is transparent to
the client or remote party. It can be used with either the GT standard
DSI plugins or with
link:../..gridftp/developer/index.html#gridftp-developer-dsi[custom-built
DSI plugins]. The standard DSI plugins available in a default GT
installation are:




* link:#gridftp-SRB[Storage Resource Broker (SRB)]


The above link point to complete information about setting up and
running the GridFTP server with these DSIs.


[[gridftp-howto-access-posix]]
==== Accessing data in a non-POSIX file data source that has a POSIX interface ====

If you want to access data in a non-POSIX file data source that has a
POSIX interface, the standard server will do just fine. Just make sure
it is really POSIX-like (out of order writes, contiguous byte writes,
etc).

 
[[gridftp-admin-experimental]]

[[gridftp-config-netlogger]]
=== Configuring GridFTP to enable Netlogger's bottleneck detection ===

For information on enabling bottleneck detection via Netlogger, see the
http://www.cedps.net/index.php/Gridftp-netlogger[Gridftp-netlogger] page
on the CEDPS website.


[[gridftp-config-multi]]
=== Configuring multicasting/broadcasting ===

To enable
link:../..gridftp/user/index.html#gridftp-user-experimental-multicasting[multicasting],
you must whitelist the ++gridftp_multicast++ driver with the
'-fs-whitelist file,gridftp_multicast' option:



--------
globus-gridftp-server -fs-whitelist file,gridftp_multicast
--------

The above command whitelists both the ++file++ driver and the
++gridftp_multicast++ driver. [NOTE]
--
The ++file++ driver is the default link:[XIO] driver that handles
reading and writing to file systems (disks). By default, this driver is
already whitelisted. However, if you use the '-fs-whitelist' option, you
must set **all** the drivers you want whitelisted (and the ++file++
driver will still be needed to allow reads and writes to disk for
non-multicast users.

--

link:../..gridftp/user/index.html#gridftp-user-experimental-multicasting[here].


[[gridftp-admin-gwtftp]]
=== GridFTP Where There Is FTP (GWTFTP) ===

GridFTP Where There Is FTP (GWTFTP) is an intermediate program that acts
as a proxy between existing FTP clients and GridFTP servers. Users can
connect to GWFTP with their favorite standard FTP client, and GWFTP will
then connect to a GridFTP server on the client’s behalf. To clients,
GWFTP looks much like an FTP proxy server. When wishing to contact a
GridFTP server, FTP clients instead contact GWTFTP.

Clients tell GWFTP their ultimate destination via the FTP **++USER ++**
command. Instead of entering their username, client users send the
following:



--------
USER <GWTFTP username>::<GridFTP server URL>
--------

This command tells GWTFTP the GridFTP endpoint with which the client
wants to communicate. For example:



--------
USER bresnaha::gsiftp://wiggum.mcs.anl.gov:2811/
--------

[NOTE]
--
Requires link:[GSI C security].

[[gridftp-admin-testing]]
== Testing ==


--
If the globus-ftp-client-test package has been installed, our standard
test suite may be run to verify functionality on your platform. Simply
set up the globus environment, chdir to
++$GLOBUS_LOCATION/test/globus_ftp_client_test/++ and run
++./TESTS.pl++.
