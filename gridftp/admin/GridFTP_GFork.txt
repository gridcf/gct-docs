= Running the Globus GridFTP Server With GFork =


[[gridftp-gfork-master-intro]]
=== Introduction ===

GFork is a user-configurable super-server daemon very similar to xinetd
in that it listens on a TCP port. When clients connect to a port, it
runs an administrator-defined program which services that client
connection, just as xinetd does.

An unfortunate drawback to xinetd is that there is no way to maintain or
share long-term information. Every time a client connects, a new process
is created; and every time that client disconnects, the process is
destroyed. All of the information regarding the specific interactions
with a given client is lost with these transient processes. A further
disadvantage is that there is no way for these service instances to
share service-specific information with each other while they are
running.

There are times when it is useful for a service to maintain long-term
service-specific state, or for a service to share state across client
connections. GFork is designed to address this situation. GFork runs a
long term master program (that is user-defined) and forms communication
links via UNIX pipes between this process and all client connection
child processes. This allows long-term state to be maintained in memory
and allows for communication between all nodes.

Associated with a GFork instance is a master process. When GFork starts,
it runs a user-defined master program and opens up bi-directional pipes
to it. The master program runs for the lifetime of the GFork daemon. The
master is free to do whatever it wants; it is a user-defined program.
Some master programs listen on alternative TCP connections to have state
remotely injected. Others monitor system resources, such as memory, in
order to best share resources. As clients connect to the TCP listener,
child processes are forked which then service the client connection.
Bi-directional pipes are opened up to the child processes as well. These
pipes allow for communication between the master program and all child
processes. The master program and the child programs have their own
protocol for information exchange over these links. GFork is just a
framework for safely and quickly creating these links.


[[gridftp-gfork-master-use-case]]
=== Use Cases ===

The creation of GFork was motivated by the Globus GridFTP server.
GridFTP can be run as a striped server where there is a frontend and
several backends. The backends run in tandem to transfer files faster by
tying together many NICs. The frontend is the contact point for the
client where transfer requests are made. When the frontend is run out of
inetd, the list of possible backends must be statically configured.
Unfortunately, backends tend to come and go. Sometimes backends fail,
and sometimes backends are added to a pool. We needed a way to have a
[fixme good synopsis: dynamic pool of backends for use in live
transfers]. To accomplish this we created GFork.


[[gridftp-gfork-config]]
=== Configuration ===

A major difference between GFork configuration and xinetd is that GFork
only runs one service per instance, where xinetd runs many services per
instance all associated with many different ports. GFork takes a single
configuration file and handles a single service. If there is demand,
GFork will be enhanced to handle many services in the way that xinetd
does.

Running the globus-gridftp-server under GFork is almost identical to
running it under xinetd. First, you need a configuration file:



--------
service gridftp2
{
env += GLOBUS_LOCATION=<path to GL>
env += LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to GL>/lib
server = <path to GL>/sbin/globus-gridftp-server
server_args = -i 
server_args += -d ALL -l <path to GL>/var/gridftp.log
port = 5000
}
--------

That portion is identical to xinetd. In fact, an existing xinetd
configuration file should work.

When running GridFTP out of GFork, the server should be run with a
master program. The master program provides enhanced functionality such
as dynamic backend registration for striped servers, managed system
memory pools and internal data monitoring for both striped and
non-striped servers.

To run with a master program, the following two lines are needed in the
config file.



--------

master = <path to GL>/libexec/gfs-gfork-master
master_args = <options>
--------

These last two options relate to the master program and work in the same
way that ++server++ and ++server_args++ do. The first line tells GFork
what master program to use (for the GridFTP server, we use
**++gfs-gfork-master++**). The second line provides options to the
master program.

The full list of master options are as follows (this is to date only,
run the program with '--help' for newer options):



**-b | --reg-cs <contact string>**::
     Contact to the frontend registry. This option makes it a data node.

**-df | --dn-file <path>**::
     Path to a file containing the list of acceptable DNs. Default is system
gridmap file.

**-G | --gsi <bool>**::
     Enable or disable GSI. Default is on.

**-h | --help**::
     Print the help message.

**-l | --logfile <path>**::
     Path to the logfile.

**-p | --port <int>**::
     Port where the server listens for connections.

**-s | --stripe-count <int>**::
     The maximum number of stripes to give to each server. A value of 0
indicates all stripes are available.

**-u | --update-interval <int>**::
     Number of seconds between registration updates.


The following is an example GFork configuration file:



--------
service gridftp2
    {
    instances = 100
    env += GLOBUS_LOCATION=/home/bresnaha/Dev/Globus-gfork3/GL
    env += LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/bresnaha/Dev/Globus-gfork3/GL/lib
    server = /home/bresnaha/Dev/Globus-gfork3/GL/sbin/globus-gridftp-server
    server_args = -i -aa
    server_args += -d ALL -l /home/bresnaha/tst.log
    server_args += -dsi remote -repo-count 1
    nice = 10
    port = 5000
    master = /home/bresnaha/Dev/Globus-gfork3/GL/libexec/gfs-gfork-master
    master_args = -port 6065 -l /home/bresnaha/master.log -G n
    master_args += -dn /home/bresnaha/master_gridmap
    }
--------

Once you have a configuration file, run GFork with:



--------
% gfork -c <path to config file>
--------


[[gridftp-gfork-striped]]
=== GFork and Striped Servers ===

As mentioned in link:#gridftp-admin-striped[], GridFTP offers a powerful
enhancement called striped servers. In this mode a GridFTP server is set
up with a single frontend and one or more backends. All of the backends
work in concert to transfer a single file and thereby achieve high
throughput rates. Here we describe how to configure one frontend and
multiple backends for use as a striped server with GFork.


[[gridftp-gfork-striped-frontend]]
==== Frontend Configuration ====

The frontend server described here is run using dynamic backends. We
need additional options for both the GridFTP server and the master
program. The following lines are added to the config file:



--------
server_args += -dsi remote 
master_args = -port 8588
master_args += -df <path to gridmap file>
--------

The first line is an additional argument to the GridFTP server. It tells
the server that it will be operating in split mode (separate frontend
and backend processes) and that it will be using the frontend.
(Specifically it tells the server to use the 'remote' DSI).

The second line tells the master program on which port it should listen
for backend registrations. Backend services can then connect to this
port to notify the frontend of their existence. By default, a
registration is good for 10 minutes, but a backend is free to refresh
its registration. In this way, a frontend is provided with the list of
possible backends (stripes) which may be used for a transfer.

The third line provides the master program with a list of authorized
DNs. Each line in the file must contain a GSI DN (certificate subject).
In order to register, the backend must authenticate and provide its DN.
The provided DN is checked against this file. In other words, the file
is a list of DNs that may register with the frontend. If the master
program is not given a '-df' option and is given the '-G' option, then
there is no registration security at all.


[[gridftp-gfork-striped-backend]]
==== Backend Configuration ====

Any striped server setup can have more than one backend service.
Furthermore, any one computer can run multiple backends. The following
explains how to set up a backend server. These steps should be repeated
for each needed backend instance.

A backend server may also be run with GFork, it just needs different
options for both the GridFTP server and the master program. A sample
backend config file is shown here:



--------
service gridftp2
{
env += GLOBUS_LOCATION=<path to GL>
env += LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to GL>/lib

server = <path to GL>/sbin/globus-gridftp-server
server_args = -i  
server_args += -dn
master = <path to GL>/libexec/gfs-gfork-master
master_args = -b localhost:8588
}
--------

Notable additions to this file are:



--------
server_args += -dn
master_args = -b localhost:8588
--------

The first line tells the GridFTP server that it will be a 'data node',
which is another name for a backend.

The second line tells the master program two things, first that it will
be a master of a data node, and second what the frontend's registration
contact point is. Note that in our example we have a hostname of
'localhost' and a port of '8588'. 8588 is (and must be) the same port
that was provided to the frontend's master program in the previous step.

Once the configuration file is complete, run GFork again as follows:



--------
% gfork -c <conf file>
--------

This will start up the data node and the master program will register
itself to the frontend and refresh its registration every 5 minutes
(default setting).


[[gridftp-gfork-memory-mgt]]
=== GFork with Memory Management ===

Another feature of the GridFTP GFork plugin is memory usage limiting.
Under extreme client loads, it is possible that GridFTP servers require
more memory than the system has available. Due to a common kernel memory
allocation scheme known as optimistic provisioning, this situation can
lead to a full consumption of memory resources and thus trigger the out
of memory handler. The OOM handler will kill processes in a
difficult-to-predict way in order to free up memory. This will leave the
system in an unpredicatable and unstable state; obviously, this is a
situation that we want to avoid.

To control this situation, the GridFTP GFork plugin has a memory
limiting option. This will attempt to limit memory usage to a given
value or to the maximum amount of RAM in the system. Most of the memory
is given to the first few connections, but when the plugin detects that
it is overloaded, each session is limited to half the available memory.

To enable this feature, one of two options must be passed to the master
program via the 'master_args' in the config file:



**-m**::
     Limits memory consumption to amount of RAM in the system.

**-M <formated int>**::
     Limits memory to the given value.


Another important option should be provided in the GFork config file:
'instance'. When a client connects to GFork, a GridFTP server instance
is executed. This instance requires a certain amount of RAM. If
connections are coming in too fast, this can act as a DOS attack.
Limiting the number of allowed simultaneous connections will help the
memory management algorithm do its job. This limit is set with:



--------
instance = <int>
--------

We recommend a value of 100 or 'RAM'/2M, whichever is smaller.

The following is an example of a GFork configuration file with memory
limiting enabled:



--------
service gridftp2
{
instance = 100  
env += GLOBUS_LOCATION=<path to GL>
env += LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to GL>/lib
server = <path to GL>/sbin/globus-gridftp-server
server_args = -i
server_args += -dn
master = <path to GL>/libexec/gfs-gfork-master
master_args = -M 512M
}
--------
