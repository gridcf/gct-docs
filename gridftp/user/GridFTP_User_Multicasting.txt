=== Multicasting ===

To transfer a single file to many destinations in a multicast/broadcast,
use the new '-mc' option.

[NOTE]
--
To use this option, the admin must enable multicasting. Click
link:../..gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-config-multi[here] for more
information.

--
[WARNING]
--
This option is EXPERIMENTAL 

--


--------
globus-url-copy -vb -p 4 -mc filename source_url
--------

The 'filename' must contain a line-separated list of destination urls.
For example: 

--------
gsiftp://localhost:5000/home/user/tst1
       gsiftp://localhost:5000/home/user/tst3
       gsiftp://localhost:5000/home/user/tst4
      
--------
For more flexibility, you can also specify a single destination url on
the command line in addition to the urls in the file. Examples are: 

--------
globus-url-copy -MC multicast.file gsiftp://localhost/home/user/src_file
--------
or 

--------
globus-url-copy -MC multicast.file gsiftp://localhost/home/user/src_file gsiftp://localhost/home/user/dest_file1
--------

==== Advanced multicasting options ====

Along with specifying the list of destination urls in a file, a set of
options for each url can be specified. This is done by appending a ++?++
to the resource string in the url followed by semicolon-separated key
value pairs. For example:



--------
gsiftp://dst1.domain.com:5000/home/user/tst1?cc=1;tcpbs=10M;P=4
--------

This indicates that the receiving host ++dst1.domain.com++ will use 4
parallel stream, a tcp buffer size of 10 MB, and will select 1 host when
forwarding on data blocks. This url is specified in the  will use 4
parallel stream, a tcp buffer size of 10 MB, and will select 1 host when
forwarding on data blocks. This url is specified in the '-mc' file as
described above.

The following is a list of key=value options and their meanings:



**P='integer'**::
     The number of parallel streams this node will use when forwarding.

**cc='integer'**::
     The number of urls to which this node will forward data.

**tcpbs='formatted integer'**::
     The TCP buffer size this node will use when forwarding.

**urls='string list'**::
     The list of urls that must be children of this node when the spanning tree is complete.

**local_write='boolean: y|n'**::
     Determines if this data will be written to a local disk, or just forwarded on to the next hop. This is explained more in the link:#gridftp-multicast-networkoverlay[Network Overlay] section.

**subject='string'**::
     The DN name to expect from the servers this node is connecting to.



[[gridftp-multicast-networkoverlay]]
==== Network Overlay ====

In addition to allowing multicast, this function also allows for
creating user-defined network routes. 

If the 'local_write' option is set to ++n++, then no data will be
written to the local disk, the data will only be forwarded on. 

If the 'local_write' option is set to ++n++ and is used with the 'cc=1'
option, the data will be forwarded on to exactly one location. 

This allows the user to create a network overlay of data hops using each
GridFTP server as a router to the ultimate destination.
