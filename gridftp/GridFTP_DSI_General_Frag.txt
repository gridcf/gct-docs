=== GridFTP and DSIs ===

The following information is helpful if you want to use GridFTP to
access data in DSIs (such as HPSS and SRB), and non-POSIX data sources.

Architecturally, the Globus GridFTP server can be divided into 3
modules: 




* the GridFTP protocol module,

* the (optional) data transform module, and

* the Data Storage Interface (DSI).


In the GT 6.0 implementation, the data transform module and the DSI have
been merged, although we plan to have separate, chainable, data
transform modules in the future.

[NOTE]
--
This architecture does NOT apply to the WU-FTPD implementation (GT3.2.1 and lower).

[[gridftp-protocol]]
==== GridFTP Protocol Module ====

The GridFTP protocol module is the module that reads and writes to the
network and implements the GridFTP protocol. This module should not need
to be modified since to do so would make the server non-protocol
compliant, and unable to communicate with other servers.


[[gridftp-data_transform]]
==== Data Transform Functionality ====

The data transform functionality is invoked by using the ERET (extended
retrieve) and ESTO (extended store) commands. It is seldom used and
bears careful consideration before it is implemented, but in the right
circumstances can be very useful. In theory, any computation could be
invoked this way, but it was primarily intended for cases where some
simple pre-processing (such as a partial get or sub-sampling) can
greatly reduce the network load. The disadvantage to this is that you
remove any real option for planning, brokering, etc., and any
significant computation could adversely affect the data transfer
performance. Note that the client must also support the ESTO/ERET
functionality as well.


[[gridftp-dsi]]
==== Data Storage Interface (DSI) / Data Transform module ====

The Data Storage Interface (DSI) / Data Transform module knows how to
read and write to the "local" storage system and can optionally
transform the data. We put local in quotes because in a complicated
storage system, the storage may not be directly attached, but for
performance reasons, it should be relatively close (for instance on the
same LAN). 

The interface consists of functions to be implemented such as send
(get), receive (put), command (simple commands that simply succeed or
fail like mkdir), etc.. 

Once these functions have been implemented for a specific storage
system, a client should not need to know or care what is actually
providing the data. The server can either be configured specifically
with a specific DSI, i.e., it knows how to interact with a single class
of storage system, or one particularly useful function for the ESTO/ERET
functionality mentioned above is to load and configure a DSI on the fly.
