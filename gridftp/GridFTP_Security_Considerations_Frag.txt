[[gridftp-security-config]]
==== Ways to configure your server ====

There are various ways to configure your GridFTP server that provide
varying levels of security. For more information, see
link:../..gridftp/admin/index.html[].


[[gridftp-security-firewalls]]
==== Firewall requirements ====

If the GridFTP **server** is behind a firewall:



. Contact your network administrator to open up port 2811 (for GridFTP
control channel connection) and a range of ports (for GridFTP data
channel connections) for the incoming connections. If the firewall
blocks the outgoing connections, open up a range of ports for outgoing
connections as well.

. Set the environment variable GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE: 
+
--------
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=min,max 
--------
where 'min','max' specify the port range that you have opened for the
incoming connections on the firewall. This restricts the listening ports
of the GridFTP server to this range. Recommended range is 1000 (e.g.,
50000-51000) but it really depends on how much use you expect.

. If you have a firewall blocking the outgoing connections and you have
opened a range of (local) ports, set the environment variable
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE: 
+
--------
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=min,max 
--------
where 'min','max' specify the port range that you have opened for the
outgoing connections on the firewall. This restricts the GridFTP server
to bind to a local port in this range for outbound connections.
Recommended range is twice the range used for GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE,
because if parallel TCP streams are used for transfers, the listening
port would remain the same for each connection but the connecting port
would be different for each connection.


[NOTE]
--
If the server is behind NAT, the ++--data-interface <real ip/hostname>++
option needs to be used on the server.

--
If the GridFTP **client** is behind a firewall:



. Contact your network administrator to open up a range of ports (for
GridFTP data channel connections) for the incoming connections. If the
firewall blocks the outgoing connections, open up a range of ports for
outgoing connections as well.

. Set the environment variable GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE 
+
--------
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=min,max 
--------
where min,max specify the port range that you have opened for the
incoming connections on the firewall. This restricts the listening ports
of the GridFTP client to this range. Recommended range is 1000 (e.g.,
50000-51000) but it really depends on how much use you expect.

. If you have a firewall blocking the outgoing connections and you have
opened a range of ports, set the environment variable
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE: 
+
--------
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=min,max 
--------
where min,max specify the port range that you have opened for the
outgoing connections on the firewall. This restricts the GridFTP client
to bind to a local port in this range for outbound connections.
Recommended range is twice the range used for GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE,
because if parallel TCP streams are used for transfers, the listening
port would remain the same for each connection but the connecting port
would be different for each connection.
