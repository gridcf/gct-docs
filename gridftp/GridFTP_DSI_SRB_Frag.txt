Last Update: August 2005

Working with the SRB team at the San Diego Supercomputing Center, we
have written a Data Storage Interface (DSI) for read/write access to
data in the Storage Resource Broker (SRB)
(http://www.npaci.edu/DICE/SRB). This DSI will enable GridFTP compliant
clients to read and write data to an SRB server, similar in
functionality to the sput/sget commands.

This DSI is currently in testing and is not yet publicly available, but
will be available from both the SRB web site (here) and the Globus web
site (here). It will also be included in the next stable release of the
toolkit. We are working on performance tests, but early results indicate
that for wide area network (WAN) transfers, the performance is
comparable. 

When might you want to use this functionality:




* You have existing tools that use GridFTP clients and you want to access data that is in SRB

* You have distributed data sets that have some of the data in SRB and some of the data available from GridFTP servers.
