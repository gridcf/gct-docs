GridFTP is a well known, extremely fast and efficient protocol for
transferring data from one destination to another. Here we present how
GridFTP can be used to transfer a single file to many destinations in a
multicast/broadcast.


--

=== Architecture ===

The purpose of this work is to efficiently transfer a single data set to
many locations. Our goal is to use all available network cycles,
effectively moving the total amount of data (destinations * file size)
at network speeds. Ideally, we would like to transfer to all
destinations in the same time it takes to transfer to a single
destination.

Distributing the data to many endpoints is not difficult, and has been a
feature of  (a popular GridFTP client) for some time. It would be quite
simple to have the client loop over the destination set and send to each
destination in series. Of course, this would be quite slow and the
transfer time would scale linearly with the data set.

In our architecture, destination servers are configured so that they can
forward packets along to other endpoints. Thus, the GridFTP servers act
as both servers receiving data and clients sending data. The server is
set up as a tree such that the first destination writes the data to disk
and then forwards it on to N more hosts (by default N is 2). This
process is repeated until all destinations have received the data.

For further explanation, the architecture can be thought of as a
directed graph. Each destination is a vertex with N edges connecting it
to N other vertices. A spanning tree is formed connecting all vertices.
The degree of any one vertex is a client -side configuration option.

The following image illustrates this:

In the image, data blocks are purple and are sent first from the client
to a root destination. The root destination then forwards it on to two
more servers.


=== Globus XIO ===

The figure in the previous section shows 4 colored boxes. Orange
represents client logic, blue is server logic, and as stated above,
purple is for data block. The final box type is yellow and it is used to
show globus XIO drivers.

More information on Globus XIO can be found link:[here]. For our
purposes we can think of each XIO driver as a modular protocol
interpreter that can be plugged in to an IO stack without involving the
application using it. In this way, we can add functionality to an
existing application without disturbing its tested code base.

Because the  uses Globus XIO for all of its IO, we are able to forward
data at the block level. We achieve this by allowing the client to add a
new XIO driver, the ++gridftp_multicast++ driver, to the GridFTP
server's disk stack. Because of the modular driver abstraction that
Globus XIO provides as the GridFTP server writes data blocks to its file
system, the data blocks are first passed through the
++gridftp_multicast++ driver. As the ++gridftp_multicast++ driver passes
the data block on to be written to disk, it also forwards the block on
to other GridFTP servers in the tree.

Using this approach to add the multicast functionality is minimally
invasive to the tested and robust GridFTP server and is entirely
modular. The driver is written to a well defined and clean abstraction.
Enabling this feature is a simple matter of inserting the driver in the
disk stack and passing the driver stack the destination list.

=== Network Overlay ===

In addition to allowing for multicast, the ++gridftp_multicast++ driver
and this architecture allow us to create a network overlay where many
GridFTP servers act as routers forwarding packets along to each other
until they get to the final destination where there are written to disk.
The advantage of this type of system is actively researched by
http://e2epi.internet2.edu/phoebus.html[Phoebus].

The ++gridftp_multicast++ driver can be configured to only forward data
along to the next server, and to not write it to disk. Furthermore, it
can be told to only forward to a single endpoint. When configured in
this way, we achieve the network overlay described above.

The following images illustrate this. In the first image we show the
standard case where data is sent from a client to a server through the
Internet. The routing is done by the Internet outside of the clients
control.

In the next image we show how the ++gridftp_multicast++ driver can route
data through the network via GridFTP servers. This allows the user to
have greater control over the network path which the data takes.

=== Results ===

To show the effectiveness of this architecture we ran experiments on the
http://www.uc.teragrid.org/tg-docs/[UC TeraGrid]. We show some of those
results here.


==== Experiment 1 ====

In the first experiment, we leased nodes from the UC TeraGrid. 29 hosts
were designated as destinations and we ran ++gridftp_multicast++-enabled
GridFTP servers on them. 1 node was designated as the client node and
from it all transfers were started. 

All transfers were performed with **++globus-url-copy++** and a tcp
buffer size of 128KB. As a control group, we ran a transfer using
**++globus-url-copy++** with the '-f' option. This caused the source
file to be sent to each endpoint in serial. We then transferred the
source to all destinations using this architecture. 

The first graph shows the completion time of a multicast session against
the number of destinations. The first line is when the transfers are
performed in a serial fashion from the client. All other lines are
multicast sessions performed using this architecture. Each line
represents a different vertex degree in the spanning tree (ie, each
server forwarding to a different number of destinations).

As expected, the results for the serial transfer scales linearly while
the multicast sessions very slowly increase with more destinations.

The next graph shows the same experiment; but instead of graphing
completion time, we graph the clients sending throughput. This is the
size of the files being sent (1GB) divided by the time it takes for this
file to reach all destinations.

The final graph shows the collective bandwidth of a transfer. The
graphing function is (# of destinations * file size) / time.

==== Future Experiments ====

We created another XIO driver that allows each endpoint in the session
to buffer the data. This prevents stalls in sending data transfers due
to the latency required to reach a leaf node, and gets data to the disks
of nodes higher in the tree faster. Early results show slight
improvements on a LAN, but we expect greater results when broadcasting
across WANs.


=== Protocol Details ===

The additions to the protocol are exceptionally minor. Every server in
the tree (except for leaf nodes) becomes a client to another server, but
that client speaks the standard GridFTP protocol. The only change needed
is a command to add the driver to the file system stack, and that
command has existed in the GridFTP server for some time.

The command is:



--------
SITE SETDISKSTACK 1*{driver name[:driver options]},
--------

The second parameter to the site command is a comma-separated list of
driver names optionally followed by a colon (:) and a set of
driver-specific URL-encoded options. From left to right, the driver
names form a stack from bottom to top.

Adding the ++gridftp_multicast++ driver to this list will enable the
multicast functionality. The set of options are the same as those
specified in the previous section. The only difference is that each url
in the urls= options must be url encoded.


=== Usage ===

The broadcast functionality can be used with **++globus-url-copy++**. We
added the following option:



--------
-mc filename
--------

The file must contain a line separated list of destination urls. For
example:



--------
gsiftp://localhost:5000/home/user/tst1
gsiftp://localhost:5000/home/user/tst2
gsiftp://localhost:5000/home/user/tst4
--------

The source url is specified on the command line as always. A single
destination url may also be specified on the command line in addition to
the urls in the file. An example globus-url-copy command is:



--------
% globus-url-copy -MC multicast.file gsiftp://localhost/home/user/src_file
--------


include::../user/index.txt[]


==== Required Server Options ====

For security reasons the GridFTP server does not allow clients to load
arbitrary xio drivers into the server. The GridFTP server admin must
whitelist the driver individually. White-listing the mlink driver is
done with the following parameter to the server:



--------
-fs-whitelist file,gridftp_multicast
--------

Notice that ++file++ must also be specified. Without this option, the
++file++ driver is the default; however, if used, you must specifically
list it.
