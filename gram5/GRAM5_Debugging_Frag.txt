Log output from GRAM5 is a useful tool for debugging issues. GRAM5 can
log to either local files or syslog. See the
link:../..gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-troubleshooting-admin[Admin
Guide] for information about how to configure logging.

In most cases, logging at the ++INFO++ level will produce enough
information to show progress of most operations. Adding ++DEBUG++ will
also allow log information from the GRAM LRM scripts.

=== Basic Debugging Methods ===

The first thing to determine when debugging unexpected failures is to
determine whether the gatekeeper service is running, reachable from the
client, and properly configured. 

First, determine that the gatekeeper is running by using a tool such as
**++telnet++** to connect to the TCP/IP port that the gatekeeper is
listening on. From the GRAM service node, using a default configuration,
use a command like: 

--------
%  telnet localhost 2119
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'
--------


An error message like the following indicates that the gatekeeper
service is not starting: 

--------
telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host
--------


If the telnet command exits immediately, then the gatekeeper service is
being started but not running. Check the gatekeeper log (by default
++$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log++) to see if there is an
error message. A common error is having a missing library path
environment variable in the gatekeeper's environment or having a
malformed configuration file. See ) to see if there is an error message.
A common error is having a missing library path environment variable in
the gatekeeper's environment or having a malformed configuration file.
See
link:../..gram5/pi/index.html#gram5-globus-gatekeeper[the**++globus-gatekeeper++**]
for information on the configuration options. 

The next recommended diagnostic is to run the same telnet command from
the machine which is acting as the GRAM client if it is distinct from
the GRAM service node. Be sure to replace ++localhost++ with the actual
host name of the GRAM service. Again, check for log entries in the case
of immediate exit or refused connection. If the connection does not
work, then there may be some network connectivity or firewall issues
preventing access. 

Next use a tool like **++globusrun++** to diagnose whether the client is
authorized to contact the gatekeeper service. This is done by using the
'-a' command-line option. For example: 

--------
%  globusrun -a -r grid.example.org

GRAM Authentication test successful

--------


If you do not get the success message above, then check the gatekeeper
log to see if there is a diagnostic message. A common problem is that
the identity of the client is not in the grid mapfile used by the
gatekeeper. 

The next test is to use the '-dryrun' option to **++globusrun++** to
verify that the job manager service is properly configured. To do so,
try the following: 

--------
%  globusrun -dryrun -r grid.example.org "&(executable=/bin/sh)"
globus_gram_client_callback_allow successful
Dryrun successful
--------


If you do not get the success message above, first check the error
number in the link:#gram5-error-codes[GRAM5 Error codes table] to
determine how to proceed. If the result is unclear, check the job
manager log (default ++$HOME/gram_DATE.log++) to see if there are any
further details of the error. ) to see if there are any further details
of the error. 

The final test is to submit a test job to the GRAM5 service and wait for
it to terminate, such as this example shows: 

--------
%  globus-job-run grid.example.org /bin/sh -c 'echo "hello, grid"'
hello, grid
--------


If the process appears to hang, it might be that the job manager is
unable to send state callbacks to the client. Check that there are no
firewalls or network issues that would prevent the job manager process
from connecting from the GRAM service node to the client node. 


=== Advanced Debugging Methods ===

The methods described in this section are intended for debugging
problems in the GRAM code, not in the user environment. 


==== Debugging the Job Manager ====

To debug the GRAM5 job manager, run the command located in
++$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-services/jobmnager-LRM++ (ignoring the first
3 fields). For example:  (ignoring the first 3 fields). For example: 

--------
%  $GLOBUS_LOCATION/libexec/globus-job-manager \
    -conf $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-job-manager.conf -type fork
--------


When the job manager is started in this way, it will log messages to
standard error and will terminate 60 seconds after its last job has
completed. This only works if there are no job managers running for this
particular user. The job manager can be started in a debugger such as
**++gdb++** or **++valgrind++** using a similar command-line.
