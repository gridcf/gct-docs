=== GRAM Client Troubleshooting ===


==== Credential Problems ====

GRAM requires a client certificate and private key in order authenticate
with the GRAM service. If these are not available, the GRAM client will
fail. In typical use, a user will create a temporary proxy certificate
either derived from their identity certificate issued by some
certificate authority, or from a service such as myproxy. If a GRAM
client command returns any error containing the string ++GSS Major
Status++ you've hit a credential problem. Look at the
link:../..gsic/user/index.html#security-credential-errors[Troubleshooting
Section] of the GSI manual for details about how to diagnose and correct
these errors. The  tool with the '-p' command-line option is especially
helpful for diagnosing some of these types of problems. 


==== Connection Problems ====

There are a few things which can go wrong when trying to contact a GRAM
service. These have slightly different error types which can help
diagnose which problem is occurring. 


===== Invalid Resource Name =====

If the hostname or TCP port you are using for a GRAM resource name is
not correct, then the GRAM client will be unable to access the service.
Errors of this type will look like this: 

--------
%  globus-job-run grid.example.org/jobmanager-fork /bin/hostname

GRAM Job submission failed because the connection to the server failed (check host and port) (error code 12)
    
--------
When this occurs, check with the resource administrator for correct
resource naming so that you can contact the service. 


===== Mutual Authentication Failure =====

GRAM performs mutual authentication, that is, both the client and
service provide certificates indicating who they are. The service uses
the client's identity to map the user to a local unix account. The
client uses the server's identity to verify that the service is running
with a host credential. The failure of the client to trust the server's
certificate will generate an error message that looks like this:
++globus_gsi_gssapi: Authorization denied: The expected name for the
remote host (host@alias.example.org) does not match the authenticated
name of the remote host (host@grid.example.org). This happens when the
name in the host certificate does not match the information obtained
from DNS and is often a DNS configuration problem.++ 

This mismatch can happen for a number of reasons: a site administrator
has multiple hosts sharing a certificate, a host has multiple DNS
aliases, and the client is not aware of which name the server is using
for its certificate, or a host's name has changed since the certificate
was issued. The remedy for the client, after confirming with the GRAM
administrator that the name after "authenticated name of the remote
host" is the correct certificate name is to use a form of the GRAM
resource name which includes this name. For example, explicitly adding a
name to the abbreviated GRAM contact so that instead of
++alias.example.org++, you would use
++alias.example.org::host@grid.example.org++. 


===== Certificate Trust Issues =====

Because of the mutual authentication, both GRAM users and services can
hit problems if they do not trust their peer's certificate or the
Certificate Authority which issued it. If the client doesn't trust the
server's certificate, it is easier to diagnose, because the GRAM service
doesn't send much information back to the client if it doesn't trust it.
However, working with the system administrator to get information from
the GRAM logs will usually fix these problems fairly easily. 

If the service's certificate is not trusted, the client will receive a
message like this: 

--------
%  globus-job-run grid.example.org /bin/hostname
GRAM Job submission failed because an authentication operation failed
OpenSSL Error: s3_clnt.c:915: in library: SSL routines, function SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: certificate verify failed
globus_gsi_callback_module: Could not verify credential
globus_gsi_callback_module: Can't get the local trusted CA certificate: Untrusted self-signed certificate in chain with hash bbfccedf
--------


This error indicates that certificate chain from the service certificate
to the client contained a self-signed certificate (usually an indication
that it's a CA certificate), which the client doesn't trust, and
includes the hash of the certificate name (++bbfccedf++ in this case).
If you hit this particular type of error, you should send the
information to the GRAM administrator and determine which CA should be
trusted and what its signing policy is, to determine if you want to add
it to your local set of trust roots. 

[NOTE]
--
Different versions of OpenSSL produce different hashes for the same
certificate names. If you upgrade a system (or transfer CA certificates
between systems) to a different version of OpenSSL, you may hit this
problem even if you think you have the CA certificate in your trusted
certificate directory. If so, run the
**++globus-update-certificate-dir++** program to update your hashes. 

--
There are other reasons why a certificate might not be trusted (it's in
a revoked list, it has expired or was issued in the future, etc). For
more details look at the
link:../..gsic/user/index.html#gsic-user-troubleshooting[troubleshooting
information] in the GSI user's guide. 

If for some reason the service does not trust your certificate, you'll
get a rather cryptic message from GRAM that looks like this: 

--------
%  globus-job-run grid.example.org /bin/hostname
GRAM Job submission failed because an authentication operation failed
globus_gsi_gssapi: Unable to verify remote side's credentials
globus_gsi_gssapi: Unable to verify remote side's credentials: Couldn't verify the remote certificate
OpenSSL Error: s3_pkt.c:1086: in library: SSL routines, function SSL3_READ_BYTES: sslv3 alert bad certificate SSL alert number 42
 (error code 7)
--------


To remedy this, consult the GRAM administrator to get information from
the ++/var/log/globus-gatekeeper.log++ file to determine the reason why
the gatekeeper didn't like your certificate. Again it could be CA trust
issues, clock skew, or a revoked certificate. The error in the
gatekeeper log would typically look like the client-side trust issue
above.  file to determine the reason why the gatekeeper didn't like your
certificate. Again it could be CA trust issues, clock skew, or a revoked
certificate. The error in the gatekeeper log would typically look like
the client-side trust issue above. 


===== Authentication with the Remote Server Failed =====

Once the GRAM service has authenticated the client, it maps the client's
identity to a local user account using a grid-mapfile or other mapping
service. If this fails, the client will receive a message that looks
like this: 

--------
%  globus-job-run grid.example.org /bin/hostname
GRAM Job submission failed because authentication with the remote server failed (error code 7)
--------


To remedy this, consult the system administrator of the GRAM resource to
be added to the authorized user's list. Be sure to send your credential
subject name to make it easier for them. To get that information, run
the command **++grid-cert-info -s++**. 


===== Unable to Find the Requested Service =====

Recall that a GRAM resource name includes a component called the
++service name++. The default if not specified is ++jobmanager++, but
some sites may not use that name, or have a different LRM name than you
expect. If you specify an incorrect service name, or the default is not
present, you'll get an error that looks like this: 

--------
%  globus-job-run grid.example.org /bin/hostname
GRAM Job submission failed because the gatekeeper failed to find the requested service (error code 93)
--------


If you get this error, you'll need to determine which services are
available on that GRAM resource, either by asking the admin or by
looking at the entries in ++/etc/grid-services++  


===== Failed to Run the Job Manager =====

The GRAM service is split between a priveleged process called the
++globus-gatekeeper++ and a non-privileged process called the  and a
non-privileged process called the ++globus-job-manager++ which runs as a
user process. If the  which runs as a user process. If the
++globus-gatekeeper++ is unable to locate the  is unable to locate the
++globus-job-manager++ process, then this misconfiguration will show up
like this:  process, then this misconfiguration will show up like this: 

--------
%  globus-job-run grid.example.org /bin/hostname
GRAM Job submission failed because the gatekeeper failed to run the job manager (error code 47)
--------


This is an installation mistake, and the administrator of the GRAM
resource must fix this. 


==== Jobs are Hanging ====

One problem GRAM users sometimes encounter is that it looks like jobs
submitted to GRAM are not making any progress, even though the local
resource manager thinks they've run. There are a couple of reasons why
this might occur: GRAM is not getting the information it needs from the
local resource manager or the GRAM client is not getting the information
it needs. We'll cover diagnosing and handling the latter case in this
document, as the other is an system administrator issue. 

The way **++globus-job-run++** and **++globusrun++** determine that jobs
have completed is via GRAM job state callbacks. These are messages sent
by the GRAM service to the client node indicating that something
significant has happened in the lifecycle of the job. If for some reason
the GRAM service can not get those messages to the client, the client
will not be able to detect job state changes. 

In order to determine if this is the case, submit a job using
**++globus-job-submit++**, and then use the **++globus-job-status++**
command to see if the job state changes. If it does not, then consult
the GRAM administrator---there might be some problem with the
installation. If it does, then for some reason the callbacks are not
happening. This might be firewall issues or host naming issues. 

The GRAM client sends a "callback contact" to the GRAM service when it
submits a job, in order that it can receive notifications. This contact
is a reference to a https server embedded in the GRAM client which only
handles GRAM state callbacks. As with all web servers, it has a URL
which defines how to contact it, which in this case consists of the
client host name and the service port number. If the host name that is
used is not resolvable (such as a for a laptop with a dynamic address),
then the GRAM service will not be able to contact it. If that's the
case, you can set the ++GLOBUS_HOSTNAME ++ environment variable to the
IP address that your client can be reached at, and then submit your
jobs. This will cause GRAM to publish that address instead of what it
thinks the client's host name is. 

Another way that the GRAM service would be unable to send job state
updates to a client would be if there's a firewall between the service
and the client. If that's the case, you might need to set the
++GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE++ environment variable to a comma-separated list
of numbers which represent a range of minimum and maximum TCP port
numbers to listen on. You might have to contact your site administrator
to determine what TCP ports are allowed. If there are none, you can
still use **++globus-job-submit++** and **++globus-job-status++** to
track your job's state changes, or use another tool like those mentioned
in the link:../..gram5/user/index.html#gram5-user-client-tools[section
about client tools]. 


==== Logs and Debugging ====

The GRAM service has a log file which contains information about the job
as it is processed. These logs are located by default in
++/var/log/globus/gram_$USERNAME.log++. There are some different logging
levels available, as . There are some different logging levels
available, as
link:../..gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-log-levels[described in the GRAM
Adminstrator's Guide]. These can be controlled on a per-job basis by
adding the ++loglevel++ RSL attribute to your job description. The
default is to log only ++FATAL++ and ++ERROR++ messages, but other
levels can sometimes help understand what is going on. 


==== Diagnosing LRM Errors ====

Sometimes, bugs creep into the LRM adapter scripts. When that occurs,
the GRAM job will usually fail with an error like this: 

--------
GRAM Job failed because the job manager detected an invalid script status (error
code 25)
--------


If this occurs, you may have to work with a GRAM administrator to help
debug this problem. One helpful thing you can do when reporting it is to
save the GRAM internal script data so that it can be used outside of the
GRAM service to see what the low-level error looks like. To do this, add
the RSL fragment ++(savejobdescription = yes)++ to your job request.
This will cause GRAM to leave a file called something like
++$HOME/gram_[0-9]*.pl++ in your home directory. You can use this with
the internal tool  in your home directory. You can use this with the
internal tool ++/usr/share/globus/globus-job-manager-script.pl++ to try
to submit the job to the LRM without using the GRAM service. The command
line  to try to submit the job to the LRM without using the GRAM
service. The command line
**++/usr/share/globus/globus-job-manager-script.pl -m ++** will attempt
to submit the job to the LRM. It will show all the information the LRM
script sends to the GRAM service, which might include some perl-language
error or badly formatted output from the script (which must only output
lines which begin with ++GRAM_SCRIPT_++. 

In some extreme cases, the savejobdescription option will not generate a
file. If that's the case, pass ++/dev/null++ as the argument to the  as
the argument to the '-f' command-line option. The problem is likely a
perl syntax error which will be reached before the job description is
loaded.
