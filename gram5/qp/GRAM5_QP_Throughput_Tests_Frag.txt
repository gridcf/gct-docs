==== Experiment Hardware and Software Configuration ====

The following experiments were run on the **++nomer.mcs.anl.gov++**
virtual cluster. The cluster consists of 6 partitions, each having a
single **++Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5430 @ 2.66GHz++** core, and 2GB RAM.
The virtual machines in the cluster each had a single virtual network
interface. The cluster was configured as follows: 

* 1 node: Master node

* 5 nodes: Test/execution nodes



All nodes ran an **++apache2++** http server, **++gmond++** (ganglia
monitoring), and **++pbs_mom++** (torque LRM). 

The master node also ran a **++globus-gatekeeper++**,
**++globus-gridftp-server++**,
**++globus-job-manager-event-generator++**, **++gmetad++** (Ganglia Meta
Daemon), **++pbs_sched++** (Torque LRM scheduler), **++pbs_server++**
(Torque LRM server), and **++nfsd++** linux kernel NFSv4 server for the
execution nodes. 

The test nodes (1 for single-client tests, 5 for multiple client tests)
ran the **++gram-throughput-tester++** program. All 5 test/execution
nodes executed the test job executables as scheduled by the LRM. 

These tests were done with GT 5.0.2 beta1. The throughput tester was
compiled from CVS trunk October 30, 2009. 


==== Experiment Scenarios ====

The first set of tests submitted jobs to the GRAM5 service for one hour.
After one hour elapsed, the client would terminate any jobs which were
being managed by the GRAM5 service. The test client recorded the time of
the experiment start, the time of the termination start, and the time
after which all jobs had reached a DONE or FAILED state. 

The throughput test client would generate a maximum of 50 simultaneous
job requests. For all but the **uncapped** test below, a maximum of 2000
jobs were managed by the job manager at any given time (pending or
active). Once the client had submitted 2000 jobs, it would stop
submissions until a job completed. A total of 10 execution slots were
available for the LRM to schedule jobs into, so many were in the GRAM5
PENDING state during the duration of the test. 

The different **++gram-throughput-tester++** experiments consisted of:

==== Throughput Test Results ====

The following table contains a summary of the results of these
experiments. The columns contain the following information: 

**Experiment**::
     Experiment name, the same as in the previous section

**Total Jobs**::
     The total number of GRAM jobs that were **submitted** to the GRAM5 service by the throughput tester in one hour.

**Termination Tasks After 1 Hour**::
     The total number of jobs that were being managed by the GRAM5 service when the one hour test period elapsed. These jobs were terminated using the GRAM5 cancel protocol message by the throughput tester.

**Termination Duration (hh:mm:ss)**::
     The amount of time it took for the termination tasks to complete and all jobs to reach the ++DONE++ or ++FAILED++ state.

**Master Node Max 1 min. Load Average**::
     The maximum value of the one-minute load average on the master node, that is, the node running the GRAM5 and Torque service.

**Master Node Average 1 min. Load Average**::
     The average value of the one-minute load average on the master node over the duration of the test.

**Errors**::
     Description of any errors which occurred on the client side that prevented operations from completing as expected.
