== RSL Validation File Specification ==

--

This is a document to specify the file format and semantics of the RSL
validation files (**RVF**) used by GRAM5 to validate an Resource
Specification Language job description document in various contexts.
This validations ensures that the RSL attribute used in the document are
understood by GRAM5, fills in any default values for missing RSL
attributes, and also matches the type of the RSL value with that of the
attribute to ensure it is valid.

[[gram5-rvf-syntax]]
=== RVF Syntax Overview ===

The core syntax of the RSL syntax is the **attribute definition
record**. Each RSL attribute definition record can define one or more
aspects of the attribute, and all but the **Attribute** aspect are
optional. 


[[gram5-rvf-definition]]
==== Attribute Definition Record Syntax ====

Syntactically, the attribute definition record consists of a series of
line-oriented attribute aspect definitions, with records separated by a
blank line. Additionally, comment strings may begin a line when the
first non-whitespace character in the line is ++#++. 


===== Aspect Name =====

The aspect name syntax is an aspect name token, which may be any
character other than the ++:++ character, then its value, which may be
either a **Simple String** or a **Quoted String**. When parsed, the
Aspect Name is transformed into a lowercase string. 


===== Simple String =====

The parser detects a Simple String by scanning the first non-whitespace
character after the ++:++ character and seeing it is not ++"++. A Simple
String's value is parsed from the first non-whitespace character until
the end of line character. Thus, in a record, the line 
--------
Attribute: executable
--------
will parse the aspect name as ++Attribute++ and the simple string value
as ++executable++ without any leading whitespace. There is no way to
indicate an empty value with a simple string. 


===== Quoted String =====

The parser detects a Quoted String by scanning the first non-whitespace
character after the ++:++ character and seeing it is ++"++. A Quoted
String's value is parsed from the ++"++ character to the next ++"++ not
preceded by the ++\++ character. Thus, a Quoted String may contain an
empty value, or span multiple lines. 


Thus, the aspect definition 
--------
Description: "The value of the \"Quoted String\"
    It may span multiple lines"
--------
will yield an aspect named **Description** with the value 
--------
The value of the "Quoted String"
    It may span multiple lines
--------



===== Record Delimiter =====

Records are separated by blank lines which are not parts of Quoted
String values. The rvf sequence 
--------
Name: record-1
Aspect_1: with an aspect

Name: some other simple value
Aspect_1: with the same aspect
    
--------
will yield two records, each with two aspects: ++Name++ and
++Aspect_1++. 


==== Aspects used by GRAM5 ====

The GRAM5 RVF parser supports the following set of attributes in record
definitions. 

*Attribute*::
     The only **required** aspect in a record, the ++Attribute++ aspect defines the name of the RSL attribute which the record refers to. The name is canonicalized to lowercase, with underscore characters removed.
*Description*::
     A description of the RSL attribute. This can be used to generate RSL documentation (see rsl.5), but is not otherwised used by GRAM5.
*RequiredWhen*::
     A list indicating when the attribute is **required** to be included in the RSL document. If it is not present, and the RVF does not include a default value for it, the RSL will be rejected. See link:#gram5-rvf-when[] for a list of valid values for this aspect.
*DefaultWhen*::
     A list indicating when the attribute's default value will be provided when not in the RSL. The default value is defined by the ++Default++ aspect described below. See link:#gram5-rvf-when[] for a list of valid values for this aspect.
*ValidWhen*::
     A list indicating when the attribute is valid in an RSL document. If the RSL attribute is included in a document which is not being used for the purpose described by this aspect's value, it will be rejected. See link:#gram5-rvf-when[] for a list of valid values for this aspect.
*Default*::
     A default value for the RSL attribute if it's used in a context which matches the ++DefaultWhen++ aspect for this attribute's record. The value of this attribute must parsable into be a valid RSL link:../..gram5/pi/index.html#gram5-rsl.value-sequence[value-sequence].
*Values*::
     An enumeration of values for the RSL attribute. The value must be simple single-word strings (such as ++yes no++. RSL documents which include the attribute this record is for and do not match one of the single-word values will be rejected by the RSL validator.
*Publish*::
     A flag, which if it equals ++true++, will cause the RSL attribute to be included in the documentation produced by the **++create_rsl_documentation.pl++** program. This is generally only useful for core RSL attributes included in GRAM5



[[gram5-rvf-when]]
===== RVF When Values =====

Several RVF aspect values are defined to include a list of contexts when
the RVF record is valid, required, or should be assigned a default
value. The list of contexts may include any number of the following
strings, separated by whitespace: 

*GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_SUBMIT*::
     The aspect relates to initial job submission RSL documents.
*GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_MANAGER_RESTART*::
     The aspect relates to GRAM5 restart RSL documents.
*GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_MANAGER_STDIO_UPDATE*::
     The aspect relates to a STDIO_UPDATE signal.



For example, the following RVF record will be valid for all three
contexts, and will provide a default value ++/dev/null++ for the
++GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_SUBMIT++ context but not the other contexts: 
--------
Attribute: stdout
Description: "The name of the remote file to store the standard output from
              the job. If the value is a GASS URL, the standard output from
              the job is transferred dynamically during the execution of the
              job. There are two accepted forms of this value. It can consist
              of a single destination: stdout = URL, or a sequence of
              destinations: stdout = (DESTINATION) (DESTINATION). In the latter
              case, the DESTINATION may itself be a URL or a sequence of an
              x-gass-cache URL followed by a cache tag."
Default: "/dev/null"
ValidWhen: GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_SUBMIT GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_MANAGER_RESTART GLOBUS_GRAM_JO
B_MANAGER_STDIO_UPDATE
DefaultWhen: GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_SUBMIT
--------



[[gram5-rvf-merging]]
==== RVF Merging ====

GRAM5 will look in multiple locations for RVF records, allowing for the
default core set of RSL attributes to be modified on a per-LRM case, as
well as on a site-specific basis. The RVF parser looks in the following
locations for RVF records in sequential order: 

*/usr/share/globus/globus_gram_job_manager/globus-gram-job-manager.rvf*::
     Core RVF definitions which apply to all LRM implementations.
*/usr/share/globus/globus_gram_job_manager/'$LRM'.rvf*::
     RVF definitions which apply to a particular LRM implementation.
*/etc/globus/gram/job-manager.rvf*::
     Site-specific RVF definitions which apply to all LRM implementations.
*/etc/globus/gram/'$LRM'.rvf*::
     Site-specific RVF definitions which apply to a particular LRM.
All but the core RVF file are optional. 


When processing multiple RVF files, GRAM5 will perform a merge with
override of RVF aspects for each record based on the record's
++Attribute++ aspect. Thus, each subsequent record for a particular RSL
attribute will replace the value of those aspects which are included in
the new record, leaving aspects which are not mentioned in the new RVF
record unchanged. To remove an aspect defined in a previous RVF record,
include the aspect with an empty Quoted Value. LRM-specific and site RVF
files can also define records for new RSL attributes. 


For example, if the core RVF records contain the following record: 
--------
Attribute: directory
Description: "Specifies the path of the directory the jobmanager will use as
              the default directory for the requested job."
Default: $(HOME)
ValidWhen: GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_SUBMIT
DefaultWhen: GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_SUBMIT
--------
a site-specific RVF entry could replace the default value by including
an RVF record like this: 
--------
Attribute: directory
Default: /scratch/ # $(LOGNAME)
--------



Similarly, a LRM which does not support memory-related resource limits
could add this record to an LRM-specific RVF file to disable those RSL
attributes for that LRM: 
--------
Attribute: min_memory
ValidWhen: ""

Attribute: max_memory
ValidWhen: ""
--------
