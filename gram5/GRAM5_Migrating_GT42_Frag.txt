==== Audit Logging ====

GRAM5 supports generating audit records the same as GRAM2. It also adds
support for a Teragrid-specific Gateway User field in the audit records.
The **++globus_gram_job_manager_auditing++** package contains the audit
database interface code. The
**++globus_gram_job_manager_auditing_setup++** setup package configures
this package. GRAM5 auditing is enabled by using the '-audit-directory'
command-line option in the job manager configuration file. For more
information about GRAM5 audit support, see the
link:../..gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-audit-logging[GRAM5 admin guide].

==== Command-line Tools ====

GRAM5 provides the **++globusrun++** program to submit jobs to GRAM5
services. It no longer supports multi-request (duroc or MPI) jobs. GRAM5
does not provide the **++globusrun-ws++** as it does not support the
WSRF protocols.

The GRAM5 version of the GRAM Client API adds support for receiving
protocol extension information in callbacks and responses. All GRAM
Client API functions from GRAM2 are provided in the GRAM5 API. The
