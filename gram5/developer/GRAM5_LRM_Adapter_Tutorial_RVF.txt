=== RSL Validation File ===

Each LRM Adapter can have a custom RSL validation file (RVF) which
indicates which RSL attributes are valid for that LRM, what their
default values are, and when they can be used during a job lifecycle. 

The RVF entries consist of a set of records containing attribute-value
pairs, with a blank line separating records. Each attribute-value pair
is separated by the colon character. The value may be quoted with the
double-quote character, in which case, the value continues until a
second quote character is found; otherwise, the value terminates at end
of line. 


==== RVF Attributes ====

The attribute names understood by the GRAM5 RVF parser are: 

**Attribute**::
     The name of an RSL attribute.

**Description**::
     A textual description of the attribute.

**RequiredWhen**::
     A sequence of link:#gram5-lrma-tutorial-rvf-when-values[WHEN-VALUES] describing when this RSL attribute must be present.

**DefaultWhen**::
     A sequence of link:#gram5-lrma-tutorial-rvf-when-values[WHEN-VALUES] describing when the default RSL value will be applied if it's not present in the RSL.

**ValidWhen**::
     A sequence of link:#gram5-lrma-tutorial-rvf-when-values[WHEN-VALUES] describing when the RSL attribute may be present.

**Default**::
     A literal RSL value sequence containing the default value of the attribute, applied to the RSL when the attribute is not present, but the RSL use matches the ++DefaultWhen++ value.

**Values**::
     A sequence of strings enumerating the legal values for the RSL attribute.

**Publish**::
     When set to ++true++, the RSL attribute will be added to the documentation for the LRM Adapter if the RVF is processed by the **++create_rsl_documentation.pl++** script. Otherwise, it will not be mentioned.



[[gram5-lrma-tutorial-rvf-when-values]]
===== RVF When Values =====

The 'WHEN-VALUES' used by the RVF parser are described in this list: 

**++GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_SUBMIT++**::
     RSL Attribute used in a GRAM5 job request to submit a job to an LRM Adapter.

**++GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_RESTART++**::
     RSL Attribute used in a GRAM5 job request to restart a job which was stopped due to a two-phase commit timeout.

**++GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_STDIO_UPDATE++**::
     RSL Attribute used in a GRAM5 STDIO_UPDATE signal, which may be sent to a job during the two-phase end state.



===== Common RSL Attributes =====

The GRAM5 service by default implements a common set of RSL attributes
for all jobs. Not all of these may be relevant to all LRM types, but are
included in the common set so that the same concept will be processed by
the same attribute for each LRM. LRM Adapters can disable particular RSL
attributes if they want by adding the attribute to their RVF file with 

--------
Attribute: AttributeName
ValidWhen: ""
--------
The common list of attributes is described in
link:../..gram5/pi/index.html#gram5-rsl-attribute-summary[]. 


==== Creating a RSL Validation File for the Fake LRM ====

Normally, the RVF for a new LRM Adapter will add any LRM-specific RSL
attributes and perhaps change the DefaultValue for some. For the
++fake++ LRM, we'll be a bit more complicated and disable most of the
GRAM common RSL attributes and reduce things to indicate the queue and
execution time for the fake jobs. The ++fake.rvf++ will do the
following:  will do the following: 

* Remove ++executable++, ++arguments++, ++directory++, ++environment++, ++file_clean_up++, ++file_stage_in++, ++file_stage_out++, ++file_stage_in_shared++, ++gass_cache++, ++gram_my_job++, ++host_count++, ++library_path++, ++max_cpu_time++, ++min_memory++, ++project++, ++queue++, ++remote_io_url++, ++scratch_dir++, ++stdin++, ++stdout++, and ++stderr++ attributes.

* Add a ++max_queue_time++ attribute, which will be the maximum time a particular fake job will be in the ++PENDING++ state. This will have a default of 20 minutes.

* Add a default value to the ++max_wall_time++ attribute of 5 minutes.
