[[gram5-developer-concepts-blocking]]
=== Blocking and Nonblocking Function Variants ===

In the GRAM Client API, all functions that involve sending messages over
the network have both blocking and nonblocking variants. These are
useful in different programming situations. 

The blocking variants, such as the
**++globus_gram_client_job_request++** function require less application
code, but will prevent subsequent instructions from executing until the
request has been sent and the reply parsed. In a non-threaded
environment, other callback functions registered with the Globus event
driver may be invoked while the blocking function is running. In a
threaded environment, other events may occur in other threads while the
function is blocking, but the current thread will be blocked until the
response is parsed. 

The nonblocking variants, such as
**++globus_gram_client_register_job_request++** require the application
to include a callback function which will be called by the Globus event
driver when the reply has been parsed. In a non-threaded environment,
applications must poll the event driver using functions from the
**++globus_poll++** or **++globus_cond_wait++** families of functions.
In a threaded environment, the callback function may be invoked in
another thread than the one calling the non-blocking function, even
before the non-blocking function has returned. Application writers must
be careful in using synchronization primitives such as
**++globus_mutex_t++** and **++globus_cond_t++** when using non-blocking
functions. 

An application writer should use the non-blocking variants if the
application will be submitting many jobs concurrently or requires custom
network or security attributes. Using the non-blocking variants allows
the Globus event driver to better schedule network I/O in these cases. 


=== Service Contact Strings ===

GRAM uses three types of **contact strings** to describe how to contact
different services. These service contacts are: 

[options='header']
.GRAM Contact String Types
|=======================================================================
| Type | Meaning | Gatekeeper Service Contact
| This string describes how to contact a
gatekeeper service. It is used to submit jobs, send
"ping" requests to determine if a service is properly
deployed, and version requests to determine what
version of the software is deployed. Full details of
the syntax of this contact is located in the next
section.
| Callback Contact
| This string is an HTTPS URL that 
is an endpoint for GRAM job state callbacks. An https
message is posted to this address when the Job Manager
detects a job state change.
| Job Contact
| This string is an HTTPS URL that
is an endpoint for contacting an existing GRAM job.
An https message is posted to this address to cancel,
signal, or query a GRAM job.
|=======================================================================



[[gram5-developer-resource-names]]
==== Resource Names ====

In GRAM5, a Gatekeeper Service Contact contains the host, port, service
name, and service identity required to contact a particular GRAM
service. For convenience, default values are used when parts of the
contact are omitted. An example of a full gatekeeper service contact is
++grid.example.org:2119/jobmanager:/C=US/O=Example/OU=Grid/CN=host/grid.example.org++.


The various forms of the resource name using default values follow: 

* 'HOST'
* 'HOST'++:++'PORT'
* 'HOST'++:++'PORT'++/++'SERVICE'
* 'HOST'++/++'SERVICE'
* 'HOST'++:/++'SERVICE'
* 'HOST'++:++'PORT'++:++'SUBJECT'
* 'HOST'++/++'SERVICE'++:++'SUBJECT'
* 'HOST'++:/++'SERVICE'++:++'SUBJECT'
* 'HOST'++:++'PORT'++/++'SERVICE'++:++'SUBJECT'

Where the various values have the following meaning: 

**'HOST'**::
     Network name of the machine hosting the service.
**'PORT'**::
     Network port number that the service is listening on. If not specified, the default of ++2119++ is used.
**'SERVICE'**::
     Path of the service entry in ++$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-services++. If not specified, the default of . If not specified, the default of ++jobmanager++ is used.
**'SUBJECT'**::
     X.509 identity of the credential used by the service. If not specified, the default of ++host@++'HOST' is used.





.Gatekeeper Service Contact Examples
=======================================================================
The following strings all name the service
++grid.example.org:2119/jobmanager:/C=US/O=Example/OU=Grid/CN=host/grid.example.org++
using the formats with the various defaults described above. 

* ++grid.example.org++
* ++grid.example.org:2119++
* ++grid.example.org:2119/jobmanager++
* ++grid.example.org/jobmanager++
* ++grid.example.org:/jobmanager++
* ++grid.example.org:2119:/C=US/O=Example/OU=Grid/CN=host/grid.example.org++
* ++grid.example.org/jobmanager:/C=US/O=Example/OU=Grid/CN=host/grid.example.org++
* ++grid.example.org:/jobmanager:/C=US/O=Example/OU=Grid/CN=host/grid.example.org++
* ++grid.example.org:2119/jobmanager:/C=US/O=Example/OU=Grid/CN=host/grid.example.org++

[[gram5-developer-jobstatecallbacks]]
=== Job State Callbacks and Polling ===

GRAM clients and learn about a job's state in two ways: by registering
for job state callbacks and by polling for status. These two methods
have different performance characteristics and costs. 

In order to receive job state callbacks, a client application must
create an HTTPS listener using the
**++globus_gram_client_callback_allow++** or
**++globus_gram_client_info_callback_allow++** functions. A non-threaded
application must then periodically call a function from either the
**++globus_cond_wait++** or **++globus_poll++** families in order to
process the job state callbacks. Additionally, the network must be
configured to allow the GRAM job manager to send messages to the port
that the client is listening on. This may be difficult if there is a
firewall between the client and service. 

The GRAM service initiates the job state callbacks, and thus they are
usually sent very shortly after the job state changes, so clients can be
notified about the state changes quickly. 

In order to poll for job states, a client can call either the blocking
or nonblocking variant of the **++globus_gram_client_job_status++** or
**++globus_gram_client_job_status_with_info++** functions. These
functions require that the network be configured to allow the client to
contact the network port that the GRAM service is listening on (the Job
Contact). 

The client intiates these polling operations, so they are only as
accurate as the polling frequence of the client. If the client polls
very often, it will receive job state changes more quickly, at the risk
of increasing the computing and network cost of both the client and
service. 


=== Credential Management ===

The GRAM5 protocols all use GSSAPIv2 abstractions to provide
authentication and authorization. By default, GRAM uses an SSL-based
GSSAPI for its security. 

The client delegates a credential to the gatekeeper service after
authentication, and the GRAM job manager service uses this delegated
credential as both a job-specific credential and for subsequent
communication with GRAM clients. 

If a client or clients submit multiple jobs to a gatekeeper service,
they will eventually all be handled by a single job manager process.
This process will use whichever delegated credential will remain valid
the longest for accepting new connections and connecting to clients to
send job state callbacks. When a client delegates a new credential to a
job, this credential may also be used as the job manager's credential
for future connections. 


=== RSL ===

GRAM5 jobs are described using the RSL language. The GRAM client API
submits jobs using the string representation of the RSL, rather than the
RSL parse tree. Clients can, if they need to modify of construct RSL at
runtime, use the functions in the RSL API to do so.
