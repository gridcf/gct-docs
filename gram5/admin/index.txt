This guide contains configuration information for system administrators
working with GRAM5. It describes procedures typically performed by
system administrators, including GRAM5 software installation,
configuration, testing, and debugging. Readers should be familiar with
the link:../../gram5/key/index.html[GRAM5 Key Concepts] to understand the
motivation for and interaction between the various deployed components.

== GRAM5 Installation ==


=== Introduction ===

The Globus Toolkit provides GRAM5: a service to submit, monitor, and
cancel jobs on Grid computing resources. In GRAM5, a job consists of a
computation and, optionally, file transfer and management operations
related to the computation. Some users, particularly interactive ones,
benefit from accessing output data files as the job is running.
Monitoring consists of querying for and/or subscribing to status
information, such as job state changes. 

GRAM5 relies on link:[] mechanisms for security, and interacts with
link:[GridFTP services] to stage files to compute resources. Please see
their respective Administrator's guides for information about
installing, configuring, and managing those systems. In particular, you
must understand the tasks in
link:../../admin/install/index.html#gtadmin-install[] and install the
basic GRAM5 packages, and complete the tasks in
link:../../admin/install/index.html#gtadmin-basic-security[]. 


=== Planning your GRAM5 installation ===

Before installing GRAM5 on a server, you'll first need to plan what
Local Resource
        Managers (LRMs) you want GRAM5 to interface with,
what LRM you want to have as your default GRAM5 service, and whether
you'll be using the **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** to process
LRM events. 

GRAM5 requires a few services to be running to function: the Gatekeeper
and the Scheduler Event Generator (SEG). The supported way to run these
services is via the System-V style init scripts provided with the
GRAM5-related packages. The gatekeeper daemon can also be configured to
start via an internet superserver such as **++inetd++** or
**++xinetd++** though that is beyond the scope of this document. The
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** can not be run in that way. 


==== Choosing an LRM Adapter ====

GRAM5 in GT 6.0 supports the following LRM adapters: Condor, PBS,
GridEngine, and Fork. These LRM adapters translate GRAM5 job
specifications into LRM-specific job descriptions and scripts to run
them, as well as interfaces to the LRM to determine job termination
status. 

If you're not familiar with the supported LRMs, you might want to start
with the Fork one to get familiar with how GRAM5 works. This adapter
simply forks the job and runs it on the GRAM5 node. You can then install
one of the other LRMs and its adapter to provide batch or
high-throughput job scheduling. 


===== Default GRAM5 Service =====

GRAM5 can be configured to support multiple LRMs on the same service
machine. In that case, one LRM is typically configured as the default
LRM which is used when a client uses a shortened version of a GRAM5
link:../../gram5/user/index.html#gram5-user-resource-names[resource
name]. A common configuration is to configure a batch system interface
as the default, and provide the ++jobmanager-fork++ service as well for
simple jobs, such as creating directories or staging data. 


===== Job Status Method =====

GRAM5 has two ways of determining job state transitions: polling the LRM
and using the Scheduler Event Generator (SEG) service. When polling,
each user's **++globus-job-manager++** will periodically execute an
LRM-specific command to determine the state of each job. On systems with
many users, or with users submitting a large number of jobs, this can
cause significant resource use on the GRAM5 service machine. Instead,
the GRAM5 service can be configured (on a per-LRM basis) to use the
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** service to more efficiently
process LRM state changes. [NOTE]
--
Not all LRM adapters provide an interface to the **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++**, and some require LRM-specific configuration to work properly. This is described in more detail.

[[gram5-admin-installing-lrm-packages]]
=== Installing LRM Adapter Packages ===

There are several LRM adapters included in the GT 6.0. For some, there
is a ++-setup-poll++ and ++-setup-seg++ package which installs the
adapter and configuration file needed for job status via polling or the
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** program. 

There are three ways to get LRM adapters: as RPM packages, as Debian
packages, and from the source installer. These installation methods are
described in link:../../admin/install/index.html[]. 

LRM adapter packages included in the GT 6.0 release are:

[[gram5-admin-managing]]
== Common Administrative Tasks ==


--
There are several tools provided with GT 6.0 to manage GRAM5, as well as
OS-specific tools to start and stop some of the services. There are
tools to manage user authorization, which services are enabled, which
scheduler event generator modules are enabled, and to test the
**++globus-gatekeeper++** service. 


--

=== Managing GRAM5 Users ===

Before a user may interact with the GRAM5 service to submit jobs, he or
she must be authorized to use the service. In order to be authorized, a
GRAM5 administrator must add the user's credential name and local
account mapping to the ++/etc/grid-mapfile++. This can be done using the
. This can be done using the
link:../../gsic/pi/index.html#grid-mapfile-add-entry[] and
link:../../gsic/pi/index.html#grid-mapfile-delete-entry[] tools. For more
information, see the link:[] manual. 


[[gram5-admin-starting-and-stopping]]
=== Starting and Stopping GRAM5 services ===

In order to run the service, the **++globus-gatekeeper++**, and, if
applicable to your configuration, the
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** services must be running on
your system. The packages for these services include init scripts and
configuration files which can be used to configure, start, and stop the
service. 

The **++globus-gatekeeper++** and
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** init scripts handle the
following actions: ++start++, ++stop++, ++status++, ++restart++,
++condrestart++, ++try-restart++, ++reload++, and ++force-reload++. The
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** script also accepts another
optional parameter to start or stop a particular
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** module. If the second parameter
is not present, then all services will be acted on. 


==== Debian Specifics ====

If you installed using Debian packaging tools, then the services will
automatically be started upon installation. To start or stop the
service, use the command **++invoke-rc.d++** with the service name and
action. 


==== RPM Specifics ====

If you installed using the RPM packaging tools, then the services will
be installed but not enabled by default. To enable the services to start
at boot time, use the commands: 

--------
#  chkconfig globus-gatekeeper on
#  chkconfig globus-scheduler-event-generator on
--------


To start or stop the services, use the **++service++** command to run
the init scripts with the service name and action and optional
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** module.


=== Enabling and Disabling GRAM5 Services ===

The GRAM5 packages described in
link:#gram5-admin-installing-lrm-packages[] will automatically register
themselves with the **++globus-gatekeeper++** and
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** services. The first LRM adapter
installed will be configured as the default Job Manager service. To list
the installed services, change the default, or disable a service, use
the link:#globus-gatekeeper-admin[] tool. 




.Using globus-gatekeeper-admin to set the default service
=======================================================================
This example shows how to use the **++globus-gatekeeper-admin++** tool
to list the available services and then choose one as the default:
--------
#  globus-gatekeeper-admin -l
jobmanager-condor [ENABLED]
jobmanager-fork-poll [ENABLED]
jobmanager-fork [ALIAS to jobmanager-fork-poll]
#  globus-gatekeeper-admin -e jobmanager-condor -n jobmanager
#  globus-gatekeeper-admin -l
jobmanager-condor [ENABLED]
jobmanager-fork-poll [ENABLED]
jobmanager [ALIAS to jobmanager-condor]
jobmanager-fork [ALIAS to jobmanager-fork-poll]
--------

=======================================================================


=== Enabling and Disabling SEG Modules ===

The ++-setup-seg++ packages described in
link:#gram5-admin-installing-lrm-packages[] will automatically register
themselves with the **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** service. To
disable a module from running when the
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** service is started, use the
link:#globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin[] tool. 
.Using globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin to disable a SEG module
=======================================================================
This example shows how to stop the ++pbs++
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** module and disable it so it
will not restart when the system is rebooted: 
--------
#  /etc/init.d/globus-scheduler-event-generator stop pbs
Stopped globus-scheduler-event-generator                   [  OK  ]
#  globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin -d pbs
#  globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin -l
pbs [DISABLED]
