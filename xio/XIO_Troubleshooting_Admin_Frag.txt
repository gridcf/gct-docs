=== Set GLOBUS_LOCATION correctly ===



* The environment variable ++GLOBUS_LOCATION++ must be set to a valid Globus 6.0 installation.

* Various other environment variables must be set in order to easily use the GlobusXIO application. The proper environment can be established by running: ++source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh++ or ++source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh++ depending on the shell you are using.
