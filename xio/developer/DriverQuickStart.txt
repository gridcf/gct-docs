=== Introduction ===

This Guide explains how to create a transport driver for Globus XIO. For
the purpose of exploring both what a transform driver is and how to
write one this guide will walk through an example driver. The full
source code for the driver can be found at
link:../globus_xio_driver_example.c[Driver Example]. This example
implements a file driver for globus_xio. If a user of globus_xio were to
put this file at the bottom of the stack, they could access files on the
local file system. 


[[x-xio-driver-quick-start-dataStructure]]
=== Data Structures ===

There are three data structures that will be explored in this example:
attribute, target, and handle. The driver defines the memory layout of
these data structures but the globus_xio framework imposes certain
semantics upon them. It is up to the driver how to use them, but
globus_xio will be expecting certain behaviors. 


[[x-xio-driver-quick-start-attributes]]
=== Attributes ===

Each driver may have its own attribute structure. The attribute gives
the globus_xio user API an opportunity to tweak parameters inside the
driver. The single attribute structure is used for all possible driver
specific attributes: 



. Target attributes

. Handle attributes

. Server attributes


How each of these can use the attribute structure will be unveiled as
the tutorial continues. For now it is simply important to remember there
is attribute structure used to initiate of the driver ADTs. 

A driver is not required to have an attribute support at all. However if
the driver author chooses to support attributes the following functions
must be implemented: 



--------
typedef globus_result_t
(*globus_xio_driver_attr_init_t)(
       void **                                                     out_attr);
        
typedef globus_result_t
(*globus_xio_driver_attr_cntl_t)(
       void *                                                       attr,
       int                                                             cmd,
       va_list                                                      ap);
        
typedef globus_result_t
(*globus_xio_driver_attr_copy_t)(
       void **                                                      dst,
       void *                                                        src);
        
typedef globus_result_t
(*globus_xio_driver_attr_destroy_t)(
       void *                                                        attr); 
--------

See
http://www.globus.org/api/c-globus-{$version}/globus%5fxio%5fgridftp%5fdriver/html/index.html[driver
API doc] for more information. 

We shall now take our first look at the file
link:../globus_xio_driver_example.c[Driver Example]. The file driver
needs a way to provide the user level programmer with a means of setting
the mode and flags when a file is open (akin to the POSIX function
++open()++). 

The first step in creating this ability is to a) define the attribute
structure and b) implement the++ globus_xio_driver_attr_init_t++
function which will initialize it: 



--------
/*
 *  attribute structure 
 */ 
struct globus_l_xio_file_attr_s
{
    int                                                                mode;
    int                                                                flags;
}
        
globus_result_t
globus_xio_driver_file_attr_init(
    void **                                                         out_attr)
{
    struct globus_l_xio_file_attr_s *            file_attr;
            
    /*
     *  create a file attr structure and initialize its values
     */
    file_attr = (struct globus_l_xio_file_attr_s *)
        globus_malloc(sizeof(struct globus_l_xio_file_attr_s));
            
    file_attr->flags = O_CREAT;
    file_attr->mode = S_IRWXU;
            
    /* set the out parameter to the driver attr */
    *out_attr = file_attr;
            
    return GLOBUS_SUCCESS;
}  
--------

The above simply defines a structure that can hold two integers, mode
and flags, then defines a function the will allocate and initialize this
structure. ++globus_xio++ hides much of the memory management of these
attribute structures from the driver. However, it does need the driver
to provide a means of copying them, and free all resources associated
with them. In the case of the file driver example, these are both
simple: 



--------
globus_result_t
globus_xio_driver_file_attr_copy(
        void **                                                        dst,
        void *                                                          src)
{
        struct globus_l_xio_file_attr_s *           file_attr;
                
        file_attr = (struct globus_l_xio_file_attr_s *)
        globus_malloc(sizeof(struct globus_l_xio_file_attr_s));
                
        memcpy(file_attr, src, sizeof(struct globus_l_xio_file_attr_s));
                
        *dst = file_attr;
                
        return GLOBUS_SUCCESS;
}
        
globus_result_t
globus_xio_driver_file_attr_destroy(
        void *                                                          attr)
{
        globus_free(attr);
                
        return GLOBUS_SUCCESS;
} 
--------

The above code should be fairly clear. Obviously we need a method with
which the user can set flags and mode. This is accomplished with the
following interface function: 



--------
globus_result_t
globus_xio_driver_file_attr_cntl(
        void *                                                                  attr,
        int                                                                        cmd,
        va_list                                                                 ap)
{   
        struct globus_l_xio_file_attr_s *                   file_attr;
        int *                                                                     out_i;
                
        file_attr = (struct globus_l_xio_file_attr_s *)attr;
        switch(cmd) 
        {
                case GLOBUS_XIO_FILE_SET_MODE:
                        file_attr->mode = va_arg(ap, int);
                        break;
                        
                case GLOBUS_XIO_FILE_GET_MODE:
                        out_i = va_arg(ap, int *);
                        *out_i = file_attr->mode;
                        break; 
                        
                case GLOBUS_XIO_FILE_SET_FLAGS:
                        file_attr->flags = va_arg(ap, int);
                        break;
                        
                case GLOBUS_XIO_FILE_GET_FLAGS:
                        out_i = va_arg(ap, int *);
                        *out_i = file_attr->flags;
                        break;
                        
                default:
                        return FILE_DRIVER_ERROR_COMMAND_NOT_FOUND;
                        break;
        }
                
        return GLOBUS_SUCCESS;
}
--------

This function is called passing the driver an ++initialized file_attr++
structure, a command, and a variable argument list. 

Based on the value of ++cmd++, the driver decides to do one of the
following: 




* set flags or mode from the ++va_args++

* return flags or mode to the user via a pointer in ++va_args++



[[x-xio-driver-quick-start-target]]
=== Target ===

A target structure represents what a driver will open. It is initialized
from a contact string and an attribute. In the case of a file driver,
the target simply holds onto the contact string as a path to the file. 

The file driver implements the following target functions:



--------
globus_result_t
globus_xio_driver_file_target_init(
        void **                                                                   out_target,
        void *                                                                     target_attr,
        const char *                                                         contact_string,
        globus_xio_driver_stack_t                               stack)
{
        struct globus_l_xio_file_target_s *                 target;
                    
        /* create the target structure and copy the contact string into it */
        target = (struct globus_l_xio_file_target_s *)
                            globus_malloc(sizeof(struct globus_l_xio_file_target_s));
        strncpy(target->pathname, contact_string, sizeof(target->pathname) - 1);
        target->pathname[sizeof(target->pathname) - 1] = '\0';
                    
        return GLOBUS_SUCCESS;
        }
                    
/*
 *  destroy the target structure
 */
globus_result_t
globus_xio_driver_file_target_destroy(
        void *                                                                     target)
{
        globus_free(target);
                    
        return GLOBUS_SUCCESS;
}
--------

The above function handles the creation and destruction of the file
driver's target structure.

[NOTE]
--
When the target is created, the contact string is copied into it. It is invalid to just copy the pointer to the contact string. As soon as this interface function returns, that pointer is no longer valid. 
--

[[x-xio-driver-quick-start-handle]]
=== Handle ===

The most interesting of the three data types discussed here is the
handle. All typical IO operations (open, close, read, write) are
performed on the handle. The handle is the initialized form of the
target and an attr. The driver developer should use this ADT to keep
track of any state information they will need in order to perform reads
and writes.

In the example case, the driver handle is fairly simple as the driver is
merely a wrapper around POSIX calls:



--------
struct globus_l_xio_file_handle_s
 {
        int                                    fd;
};
--------

The reader should review the following functions in
link:../globus_xio_driver_example.c[Driver Example] in order to see how
the handle structure is used:




* ++globus_xio_driver_file_open()++

* ++globus_xio_driver_file_write()++

* ++globus_xio_driver_file_read()++

* ++globus_xio_driver_file_close()++



[[x-xio-driver-quick-start-IO-Operations]]
=== IO Operations ===

The read and write interface functions are called in response to a user
read or write request. Both functions are provided with a vector that
has at least the same members as the ++struct iovec++ and a vector
length. As of now, the iovec elements may contain extra members, so if
you wish to use ++readv()++ or ++writev()++, you will have to transfer
the ++iov_base++ and ++iov_len++ members to the POSIX iovec.

As with the open and close interface functions, if an error occurs
before any real processing has occurred, the interface function may
simply return the error (in a ++result_t++), effectively canceling the
operation. However, once bytes have been read or written, you must not
return the error. You must report the number of bytes read/written along
with the result.

When an operation is done, either by error or successful completion, the
operation must be 'finished'. To do this, a call must be made to: 



--------
globus_result_t
globus_xio_driver_finished_read/write(
    globus_xio_driver_operation_t                       op, 
    globus_result_t                                                 res, 
    globus_ssize_t                                                  nbytes);
--------


[[x-xio-driver-quick-start-calls]]
==== Blocking vs Non-blocking Calls ====

In general, the driver developer does not need to concern himself with
how the user made the call. Whether it was a blocking or an asynchronous
call, XIO will handle things correctly.

However the call was made, the driver developer can call
globus_xio_driver_finished_{open, read, write, close} either while in
the original interface call, in a separate thread, or in a separate
callback kick out via the globus_callback API. 


[[x-xio-driver-quick-start-glue]]
=== The Glue ===

Through a process not finalized yet, XIO will request the
++globus_xio_driver_t++ structure from the driver. This structure
defines all of the interface functions that the driver supports. In
detail: 



--------
/*
