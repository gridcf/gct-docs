== Deploying ==


--
Once a user has a successful installation of Globus XIO they may wish to
use their own drivers. Once the driver is compiled, it can be used at
runtime by Globus XIO so long as it can be found in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

[[xio-admin-testing]]
== Testing ==


--
A test suite is available to test the Globus XIO framework. The tests
are included in the XIO source packages, and are run automatically when
the XIO binary packages are generated. If you are building from the source
installer, you can run the following command to run the tests:

--------
    % make globus_xio-check
