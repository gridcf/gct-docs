This document describes how to acquire and use the certificates that you
will need to authenticate yourself to Globus services.

== Usage scenarios ==


[[gsic-user-basic-procedure]]
=== Basic procedure for using GSI C ===

In most cases, an individual will do the following: 

* Acquire a user certificate from a certification authority (CA) with link:../..gsic/user/index.html#grid-cert-request[grid-cert-request]. This certificate will typically be valid for a year or more and will be stored in a file in the individual's home directory.
+
It is important to keep in mind when your cert will expire - after your user certificate expires, you may not be able to use secure services in GT!

* Use the end-user certificate to create a proxy certificate using link:../..gsic/user/index.html#grid-proxy-init[grid-proxy-init]. This will be used to authenticate the individual to grid services. Proxy certificates typically have a much shorter lifetime than end-user certificates (usually 12 hours). Once your proxy certificate expires, simply rerun **++grid-proxy-init++**.
