.Overview
--
GSI uses public key cryptography (also known as asymmetric cryptography)
as the basis for its functionality. Many of the terms and concepts used
in this description of GSI come from its use of public key cryptography.

For a good overview of GSI contained in the Web Services-based
components of GT4, see link:../../GT4-GSI-Overview.pdf[Globus Toolkit
Version 4 Grid Security Infrastructure: A Standards Perspective].
A reference for detailed information about public key cryptography is
available in the book http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/[Handbook of
Applied Cryptography], by A. Menezes, P. van Oorschot, and S. Vanstone,
CRC Press, 1996.
http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap8.pdf[Chapter 8] of this
book deals exclusively with public key cryptography. 
The primary motivations behind GSI are: 


* The need for secure communication (authenticated and perhaps confidential) between elements of a computational Grid.

* The need to support security across organizational boundaries, thus prohibiting a centrally-managed security system.

* The need to support "single sign-on" for users of the Grid, including delegation of credentials for computations that involve multiple resources and/or sites.

[[gsic-key-concepts]]
== Conceptual Details ==


[[gsic-key-publickey]]
=== Public Key Cryptography ===

The most important thing to know about public key cryptography is that,
unlike earlier cryptographic systems, it relies not on a single key (a
password or a secret "code"), but on two keys. These keys are numbers
that are mathematically related in such a way that if either key is used
to encrypt a message, the other key must be used to decrypt it. Also
important is the fact that it is next to impossible (with our current
knowledge of mathematics and available computing power) to obtain the
second key from the first one and/or any messages encoded with the first
key. 

By making one of the keys available publicly (a public key) and keeping
the other key private (a private key), a person can prove that he or she
holds the private key simply by encrypting a message. If the message can
be decrypted using the public key, the person must have used the private
key to encrypt the message. 

**Important:** It is critical that private keys be kept private! Anyone
who knows the private key can easily impersonate the owner. 


[[gsic-key-digitalsig]]
=== Digital Signatures ===

Using public key cryptography, it is possible to digitally "sign" a
piece of information. Signing information essentially means assuring a
recipient of the information that the information hasn't been tampered
with since it left your hands. 

To sign a piece of information, first compute a mathematical hash of the
information. (A hash is a condensed version of the information. The
algorithm used to compute this hash must be known to the recipient of
the information, but it isn't a secret.) Using your private key, encrypt
the hash, and attach it to the message. Make sure that the recipient has
your public key. 

To verify that your signed message is authentic, the recipient of the
message will compute the hash of the message using the same hashing
algorithm you used, and will then decrypt the encrypted hash that you
attached to the message. If the newly-computed hash and the decrypted
hash match, then it proves that you signed the message and that the
message has not been changed since you signed it. 


[[gsic-key-certificates]]
=== Certificates ===

A central concept in GSI authentication is the **certificate**. Every
user and service on the Grid is identified via a certificate, which
contains information vital to identifying and authenticating the user or
service.

A GSI certificate includes four primary pieces of information:




* A subject name, which identifies the person or object that the certificate represents.

* The public key belonging to the subject.

* The identity of a Certificate Authority (CA) that has signed the certificate to certify that the public key and the identity both belong to the subject.

* The digital signature of the named CA.


Note that a third party (a CA) is used to certify the link between the
public key and the subject in the certificate. In order to trust the
certificate and its contents, the CA's certificate must be trusted. The
link between the CA and its certificate must be established via some
non-cryptographic means, or else the system is not trustworthy.

GSI certificates are encoded in the X.509 certificate format, a standard
data format for certificates established by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). These certificates can be shared with other public
key-based software, including commercial web browsers from Microsoft and
Netscape.


[[gsic-key-mutualauthentication]]
=== Mutual Authentication ===

If two parties have certificates, and if both parties trust the CAs that
signed each other's certificates, then the two parties can prove to each
other that they are who they say they are. This is known as **mutual
authentication**. GSI uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for its mutual
authentication protocol, which is described
link:#gsic-key-delegation[below]. (SSL is also known by a new, IETF
standard name: Transport Layer Security, or TLS.)

Before mutual authentication can occur, the parties involved must first
trust the CAs that signed each other's certificates. In practice, this
means that they must have copies of the CAs' certificates--which contain
the CAs' public keys--and that they must trust that these certificates
really belong to the CAs.

To mutually authenticate, the first person (**A**) establishes a
connection to the second person (**B**). 

To start the authentication process, **A** gives **B** his certificate. 

The certificate tells **B** who **A** is claiming to be (the identity),
what **A**'s public key is, and what CA is being used to certify the
certificate. 

**B** will first make sure that the certificate is valid by checking the
CA's digital signature to make sure that the CA actually signed the
certificate and that the certificate hasn't been tampered with. (This is
where **B** must trust the CA that signed **A**'s certificate.) 

Once **B** has checked out **A**'s certificate, **B** must make sure
that **A** really is the person identified in the certificate. 

**B** generates a random message and sends it to **A**, asking **A** to
encrypt it. 

**A** encrypts the message using his private key, and sends it back to
**B**. 

**B** decrypts the message using **A**'s public key. 

If this results in the original random message, then **B** knows that
**A** is who he says he is. 

Now that **B** trusts **A**'s identity, the same operation must happen
in reverse. 

**B** sends **A** her certificate, **A** validates the certificate and
sends a challenge message to be encrypted. 

**B** encrypts the message and sends it back to **A**, and **A**
decrypts it and compares it with the original. 

If it matches, then **A** knows that **B** is who she says she is. 

At this point, **A** and **B** have established a connection to each
other and are certain that they know each others' identities. 


[[gsic-key-confcommunication]]
=== Confidential Communication ===

By default, GSI does not establish confidential (encrypted)
communication between parties. Once mutual authentication is performed,
GSI gets out of the way so that communication can occur without the
overhead of constant encryption and decryption. 

GSI can easily be used to establish a shared key for encryption if
confidential communication is desired. Recently relaxed United States
export laws now allow us to include encrypted communication as a
standard optional feature of GSI. 

A related security feature is communication integrity. Integrity means
that an eavesdropper may be able to read communication between two
parties but is not able to modify the communication in any way. GSI
provides communication integrity by default. (It can be turned off if
desired). Communication integrity introduces some overhead in
communication, but not as large an overhead as encryption. 


[[gsic-key-securingprivatekeys]]
=== Securing Private Keys ===

The core GSI software provided by the Globus Toolkit expects the user's
private key to be stored in a file in the local computer's storage. To
prevent other users of the computer from stealing the private key, the
file that contains the key is encrypted via a password (also known as a
passphrase). To use GSI, the user must enter the passphrase required to
decrypt the file containing their private key. 

We have also prototyped the use of cryptographic smartcards in
conjunction with GSI. This allows users to store their private key on a
smartcard rather than in a file system, making it still more difficult
for others to gain access to the key. 


[[gsic-key-delegation]]
=== Delegation, Single Sign-On and Proxy Certificates ===

GSI provides a delegation capability: an extension of the standard SSL
protocol which reduces the number of times the user must enter his
passphrase. If a Grid computation requires that several Grid resources
be used (each requiring mutual authentication), or if there is a need to
have agents (local or remote) requesting services on behalf of a user,
the need to re-enter the user's passphrase can be avoided by creating a
**proxy**. 

A proxy consists of a new certificate and a private key. The key pair
that is used for the proxy, i.e. the public key embedded in the
certificate and the private key, may either be regenerated for each
proxy or obtained by other means. The new certificate contains the
owner's identity, modified slightly to indicate that it is a proxy. The
new certificate is signed by the owner, rather than a CA. (See diagram
below.) The certificate also includes a time notation after which the
proxy should no longer be accepted by others. Proxies have limited
lifetimes.

The proxy's private key must be kept secure, but because the proxy isn't
valid for very long, it doesn't have to kept quite as secure as the
owner's private key. It is thus possible to store the proxy's private
key in a local storage system without being encrypted, as long as the
permissions on the file prevent anyone else from looking at them easily.
Once a proxy is created and stored, the user can use the proxy
certificate and private key for mutual authentication without entering a
password.

When proxies are used, the mutual authentication process differs
slightly. The remote party receives not only the proxy's certificate
(signed by the owner), but also the owner's certificate. During mutual
authentication, the owner's public key (obtained from her certificate)
is used to validate the signature on the proxy certificate. The CA's
public key is then used to validate the signature on the owner's
certificate. This establishes a chain of trust from the CA to the proxy
through the owner. 

[NOTE]
--
GSI, and software based on it (notably the Globus Toolkit, GSI-SSH, and GridFTP), is currently the only software which supports the delegation extensions to TLS (a.k.a. SSL). The Globus Alliance has worked in the GGF and the IETF to standardize this extension in the form of Proxy Certificates (RFC 3820) [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3820.txt[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3820.txt]].
