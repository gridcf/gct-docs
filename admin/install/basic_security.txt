== Basic Security Configuration ==


[[gtadmin-basic-host]]
=== Obtain host credentials ===

You must have X.509 certificates to use the GT 6.0 software securely
(referred to in this documentation as **host certificates**). For an
overview of certificates for GSI (security) see
link:../..gsic/admin/index.html#gsic-configuring[GSI Configuration
Information] and
link:../..gsic/developer/index.html#gsic-developer-env[GSI Environment
Variables].

If you will need to be interoperable with other sites, you will need to
obtain certs from a trusted Certificate Authority, such as those that
are included in http://www.igtf.net[IGTF]. If you are simply testing the
software on your own resources, SimpleCA offers an easy way to create
your own certificates (see section below).

Host credentials must:




* consist of the following two files: ++hostcert.pem++ and  and ++hostkey.pem++

* be in the appropriate directory for secure services: ++/etc/grid-security/++

* match the hostname for a the machine. If the machine is going to be accessed remotely, the name on the certificate must match the network-visible hostname.


You have the following options:


[[gtadmin-basic-existing]]
==== Request a certificate from an existing CA ====

Your best option is to use an already existing CA. You may have access
to one from the company you work for or an organization you are
affiliated with. Some universities provide certificates for their
members and affiliates. Contact your support organization for details
about how to acquire a certificate. You may find your CA listed in the
http://www.tacar.org/[TERENA Repository]. 

If you already have a CA, you will need to follow their configuration
directions. If they include a CA setup package, follow the CAs
instruction on how to install the setup package. If they do not, you
will need to create an ++/etc/grid-security/certificates++ directory and
include the CA cert and signing policy in that directory. See  directory
and include the CA cert and signing policy in that directory. See
link:../..gsic/admin/index.html#gsic-configuring[Configuring a Trusted
CA] for more details. 

This type of certificate is best for service deployment and Grid
inter-operation. 


[[gtadmin-basic-simpleca]]
==== SimpleCA ====

SimpleCA provides a wrapper around the OpenSSL CA functionality and is
sufficient for simple Grid services. Alternatively, you can use
OpenSSL's **++CA.sh++** command on its own. Instructions on how to use
the SimpleCA can be found in
link:../../admin/install/appendix.html#gtadmin-simpleca[]. 

SimpleCA is suitable for testing or when a certificate authority is not
available.

If you install the **++globus-simpleca++** native package, it will
automatically create a CA and host certificate if you don't have one
configured yet. Otherwise, you'll need to use **++grid-ca-create++** to
create the CA and **++grid-default-ca++** to make that the default for
requesting credentials. 

To create user credentials, you can run the command
**++grid-cert-request++** as a user that you want to create a credential
for. You can then run the **++grid-ca-sign++** command as the
**++simpleca++** user to sign the certificate. 


[[gtadmin-basic-gridmap]]
=== Add authorization ===

Installing Globus services on your resources doesn't automatically
authorize users to use these services. Each user must have their own
user certificate, and each user certificate must be mapped to a local
account.

To add authorizations for users, you'll need to update the
++grid-mapfile++ database to include the mapping between the credentials
and the local user accounts. database to include the mapping between the
credentials and the local user accounts.

You'll need two pieces of information:




* the subject name of a user's certificate

* the local account name that the certificate holder can access.


To start with, if you have created a user certificate, you can run the
**++grid-cert-info++** command to get the certificate's subject name,
and **++id -un++** to get the account name:



--------
globus% grid-cert-info -subject
/O=Grid/OU=GlobusTest/OU=simpleCA-elephant.globus.org/CN=Globus User
globus% id -un
globus
--------

You may add the line by running the following command as root:



--------
root# grid-mapfile-add-entry \
    -dn "/O=Grid/OU=GlobusTest/OU=simpleCA-elephant.globus.org/CN=Globus User" \
    -ln gtuser
Modifying /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile ...
/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile does not exist... Attempting to create /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile 
New entry:
"/O=Grid/OU=GlobusTest/OU=simpleCA-elephant.globus.org/CN=Globus User" globus
(1) entry added
--------

[IMPORTANT]
--
The quotes around the subject name are **important**, because it contains spaces.

[[gtadmin-basic-verify]]
=== Verify Basic Security ===

Now that you have installed a trusted CA, acquired a hostcert and
acquired a usercert, you may verify that your security setup is
complete. As your user account, run the following command: 



--------
gtuser$ grid-proxy-init -verify -debug

User Cert File: /home/gtuser/.globus/usercert.pem
User Key File: /home/gtuser/.globus/userkey.pem

Trusted CA Cert Dir: /etc/grid-security/certificates

Output File: /tmp/x509up_u506
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=GT User 332900
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy ...++++++++++++
..................++++++++++++
 Done
Proxy Verify OK
Your proxy is valid until: Fri Jan 28 23:13:22 2005
--------

There are a few things you can notice from this command. Your usercert
and key are located in ++$HOME/.globus/++. The proxy certificate is
created in . The proxy certificate is created in ++/tmp/++. The "up"
stands for "user proxy", and the . The "up" stands for "user proxy", and
the '_u506' will be your UNIX userid. It also prints out your
distinguished name (DN), and the proxy is valid for 12 hours. 

If this command succeeds, your single node is correctly configured. 

If you get an error, or if you want to see more diagnostic information
about your certificates, run the following:



--------
gtuser$ grid-cert-diagnostics

[[gt-admin-firewall]]
=== Firewall configuration ===

There are four possible firewall scenarios that might present
themselves: restrictions on incoming and outgoing ports for both client
and server scenarios.

This section divides sites into two categories: client sites, which have
users that are acting as clients to Grid services, and server sites,
which are running Grid services. Server sites also often act as client
sites either because they also have users on site or jobs submitted by
users to the site act as clients to other sites by retrieving data from
other sites or spawning sub-jobs.


==== Client Site Firewall Requirements ====

This section describes the requirements placed on firewalls at sites
containing Globus Toolkit clients. Note that often jobs submitted to
sites running Globus services will act as clients (e.g. retrieving files
needed by the job, spawning subjobs), so server sites will also have
client site requirements.


===== Allowed Outgoing Ports =====

Clients need to be able to make outgoing connections freely from
ephemeral ports on hosts at the client site to all ports at server
sites.


[[gtadmin-client-incomingports]]
===== Allowed Incoming Ports =====

As described in
link:../..gram5/developer/index.html#gram5-developer-jobstatecallbacks[],
the Globus Toolkit GRAM service uses callbacks to communicate state
changes to clients and, optionally, to stage files to/from the client.
If connections are not allowed back to the Globus Toolkit clients, the
following restrictions will be in effect: 




* You cannot do a job submission request and redirect the output back to the client. This means the globus-job-run command won't work. globus-job-submit will work, but you cannot use globus-job-get-output. globusrun with the -o option also will not work.

* Staging to or from the client will also not work, which precludes the -s and -w options.

* The client cannot be notified of state changes in the job, e.g. completion.


To allow these callbacks, client sites should allow incoming connection
in the ephemeral port range. Client sites wishing to restrict incoming
connections in the ephemeral port range should select a port range for
their site. The size of this range should be approximately 10 ports per
expected simultaneous user on a given host, though this may vary
depending on the actual usage characteristics. Hosts on which clients
run should have the GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE environment variable set for
the users to reflect the site’s chosen range.


===== Network Address Translation (NAT) =====

Clients behind NATs will be restricted as described in
link:#gtadmin-client-incomingports[] unless the firewall and site hosts
are configured to allow incoming connections.

This configuration involves: 

* Select a separate portion of the ephemeral port range for each host at the site on which clients will be running (e.g. 45000-45099 for host A, 45100-45199 for host B, etc.).

* Configure the NAT to direct incoming connections in the port range for each host back to the appropriate host (e.g., configure 45000-45099 on the NAT to forward to 45000-45099 on host A).

* Configure the Globus Toolkit clients on each site host to use the selected port range for the host using the techniques described in link:../..gridftp/user/index.html#gridftp-user-config-client-firewall[].

* Configure Globus Toolkit clients to advertise the firewall as the hostname to use for callbacks from the server host. This is done using the GLOBUS_HOSTNAME environment variable. The client must also have the GLOBUS_HOSTNAME environment variable set to the hostname of the external side of the NAT firewall. This will cause the client software to advertise the firewall's hostname as the hostname to be used for callbacks causing connections from the server intended for it to go to the firewall (which redirects them to the client).




==== Server Site Firewall Requirements ====

This section describes firewall policy requirements at sites that host
Grid services. Sites that host Grid services often host Grid clients,
however the policy requirements described in this section are adequate
for clients as well.


===== Allowed Incoming Ports =====

A server site should allow incoming connections to the well-known Grid
Service Ports as well as ephemeral ports. These ports are 22/tcp (for
gsi-enabled openssh), 2119/tcp (for GRAM) and 2811/tcp for GridFTP.

A server not allowing incoming connections in the ephemeral port range
will have the following restrictions: 

* If port 2119/tcp is open, GRAM will allow jobs to be submitted, but further management of the jobs will not be possible.

* While it will be possible to make GridFTP control connections if port 2811/tcp is open, it will not possible to actually get or put files.



Server sites wishing to restrict incoming connections in the ephemeral
port range should select a range of port numbers. The size of this range
should be approximately 20 ports per expected simultaneous user on a
given host, though this may vary depending on the actual usage
characteristics. While it will take some operational experience to
determine just how big this range needs to be, it is suggested that any
major server site open a port range of at least a few hundred ports.
Grid Services should configured as described in Section to reflect the
site’s chosen range.


===== Allowed Outgoing Ports =====

Server sites should allow outgoing connections freely from ephemeral
ports at the server site to ephemeral ports at client sites as well as
to Grid Service Ports at other sites.


===== Network Address Translation (NAT) =====

Grid services are not supported to work behind NAT firewalls because the
security mechanisms employed by Globus require knowledge of the actual
IP address of the host that is being connected to.

We do note there have been some successes in running GT services behind
NAT firewalls.

|=======================================================================


==== Controlling The Ephemeral Port Range ====

Controllable ephemeral ports in the Globus Toolkit can be restricted to
a given range. setting the environment variable GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
can restrict ephemeral ports. The value of this variable should be
formatted as min,max (a comma separated pair). This will cause the GT
libraries (specifically GlobusIO) to select port numbers for
controllable ports in that specified range. 

--------
% GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=40000,40010
% export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
% globus-gass-server
https://globicus.lbl.gov:40000
^C
%
--------
This environment variable is respected by both clients and servers that
are started from within the environment in which it is set. There are
better ways, however, to configure a globus-job-manager or a GridFTP
server to restrict its port range. 

* globus-job-manager has an option, -globus-tcp-port-range PORT_RANGE that acts in the same manner as the environment variable. It can be specified on the command line or in the configuration file. See the link:../..gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-cmd-globus-job-manager[job manager documentation] for all of its options.

* See the link:../..gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-config-security-firewalls[GridFTP documentation] for information about using GridFTP with firewalls.
