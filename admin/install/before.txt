== Before you begin ==

Before you start installing the Globus Toolkit 6.0, there are a few
things you should consider. The toolkit contains several components, and
you may only be interested in some of them. 

The Globus Toolkit version 6.0 includes:

* link:../../gsic/index.html[GSI]: security
* link:../../gridftp/index.html[GridFTP]: file transfer
* link:../../gram5/index.html[GRAM]: job execution/resource management
* link:../../myproxy/index.html[MyProxy]: credential repository/certificate
  authority
* link:../../gsiopenssh/index.html[GSI-OpenSSH]: GSI secure single sign-on
  remote shell

If you are new to the toolkit and want to experiment with the
components, you may want to use a supported RedHat based or Debian based
Linux system. With the new supported native packaging installs, they are
the simplest platforms on which to install GT services. 

For the purposes of this documentation, Globus is being installed on a
machine called **++elephant++**.
