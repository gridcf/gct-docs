=== Admin Troubleshooting ===


==== Security ====

GRAM requires a host certificate and private key in order for the
**++globus-gatekeeeper++** service to run. These are typically located
in ++/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem++ and  and
++/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem++, but the path is configurable in the
, but the path is configurable in the
link:../../gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-configuring-gatekeeper[gatekeeper
configuration file]. The key must be protected by file permissions
allowing only the root user to read it. 

GRAM also (by default) uses a ++grid-mapfile++ to authorize Grid users
as local users. This file is typically located in  to authorize Grid
users as local users. This file is typically located in
++/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile++, but is configurable in the , but is
configurable in the
link:../../gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-configuring-gatekeeper[gatekeeper
configuration file]. 

Problems in either of these configurations will show up in the
gatekeeper log described below. See the link:../../gsic/index.html[GSI]
documentation for
more detailed information about obtaining and installing host
certificates and maintaining a ++grid-mapfile++. . 


==== Verify that Services are Running ====

GRAM relies on the **++globus-gatekeeper++** program and (in some cases)
the **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** programs to process jobs.
If the former is not running, jobs requests will fail with a "connection
refused" error. If the latter is not running, GRAM jobs will appear to
"hang" in the ++PENDING++ state. 

The **++globus-gatekeeper++** is typically started via an init script
installed in ++/etc/init.d/globus-gatekeeper++. The command . The
command **++/etc/init.d/globus-gatekeeper status++** will indicate
whether the service is running. See
link:../../gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-admin-starting-and-stopping[Starting
and Stopping GRAM5 services] for
more information about starting and stopping the
**++globus-gatekeeper++** program. 

If the **++globus-gatekeeper++** service fails to start, the output of
the command **++globus-gatekeeper -test++** will output information
describing some types of configuration problems. 

The **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** is typically started via an
init script installed in
++/etc/init.d/globus-scheduler-event-generator++. It is only needed when
the LRM-specific "setup-seg" package is installed. The command . It is
only needed when the LRM-specific "setup-seg" package is installed. The
command **++/etc/init.d/globus-scheduler-event-generator status++** will
indicate whether the service is running. See
link:../../gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-admin-starting-and-stopping[Starting
and Stopping GRAM5 services] for
more information about starting and stopping the
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** program. 


==== Verify that LRM packages are installed ====

The **++globus-gatekeeper++** program starts the
**++globus-job-manager++** service with different command-line
parameters depending on the LRM being used. Use the command
**++globus-gatekeeper-admin -l++** to list which LRMs the gatekeeper is
configured to use. 

The **++globus-job-manager-script.pl++** is the interface between the
GRAM job manager process and the LRM adapter. The command
**++/usr/share/globus/globus-job-manager-script.pl -h++** will print the
list of available adapters. 

--------
%  /usr/share/globus/globus-job-manager-script.pl -h
USAGE: /usr/share/globus/globus-job-manager-script.pl -m MANAGER -f FILE -c COMMAND
Installed managers: condor fork
--------


The **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** also uses an LRM-specific
module to generate scheduler events for GRAM to reduce the amount of
resources GRAM uses on the machine where it runs. To determine which
LRMs are installed and configured, use the command
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin -l++**. 

--------
%  globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin -l
fork [DISABLED]
--------


If any of these do not show the LRM you are trying to use, install the
relevant packages related to that LRM and restart the GRAM services. See
the link:../../gram5/admin/index.html[GRAM Administrator's Guide] for
more information about starting and stopping the GRAM services. 


==== Verify that the LRM packages are configured ====

All GRAM5 LRM adapters have a configuration file for site
customizations, such as queue names, paths to executables needed to
interface with the LRM, etc. Check that the values in these files are
correct. These files are described in
link:../../gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-configuring-lrm[LRM Adapter
Configuration].


[[gram5-troubleshooting-gatekeeper-log]]
==== Check the Gatekeeper Log ====

The ++/var/log/globus-gatekeeper.log++ file contains information about
service requests from clients, and will be useful when diagnosing
service startup failures, authentication failures, and authorization
failures.  file contains information about service requests from
clients, and will be useful when diagnosing service startup failures,
authentication failures, and authorization failures. 


===== Authorization failures =====

GRAM uses GSI to authenticate client job requests. If there is a problem
with the GSI configuration for your host, or a client is trying to
connect with a certificate signed by a CA your host does not trust, the
job request will fail. This will show up in the log as a "GSS
authentication failure". See the link:../../gsic/admin/index.html[GSI
Administrator's Guide] for information about diagnosing authentication
failures. 


===== Gridmap failures =====

After authentication is complete, GRAM maps the Grid identity to a local
user prior to starting the **++globus-job-manager++** process. If this
fails, an error will show up in the log as "globus_gss_assist_gridmap()
failed authorization". See the link:../../gsic/admin/index.html[GSI
Administrator's Guide] for information about managing gridmap files. 


[[gram5-troubleshooting-jobmanager-log]]
==== Job Manager Logs ====

A per-user job manager log is typically located in
++/var/log/globus/gram_$USERNAME.log++. This log contains information
from the job manager as it attempts to execute GRAM jobs via a local
resource manager. The logs can be fairly verbose. Sometimes looking for
log entries near those containing the string . This log contains
information from the job manager as it attempts to execute GRAM jobs via
a local resource manager. The logs can be fairly verbose. Sometimes
looking for log entries near those containing the string ++level=ERROR++
will show more information about what caused a particular failure. 

Once you've found an error in the log, it is generally useful to find
log entries related to the job which hit that error. There are two job
IDs associated with each job, one a GRAM-specific ID, and one an
LRM-specific ID. To determine the GRAM ID associated with a job, look
for the attribute ++gramid++ in the log message. Finding that, looking
for all other log messages which contain that ++gramid++ value will give
a better picture of what the job manager is doing. To determine the
LRM-specific ID, look for a message at ++TRACE++ level with the matching
GRAM ID found above with the ++response++ value matching
++GRAM_SCRIPT_JOB_ID:++'LRM-ID'. You can then find follow the state of
the 'LRM-ID' as well as the GRAM ID in the log, and correlate the
'LRM-ID' information with local resource manager logs and administrative
tools.
